Mentioned in:
- [[Killasimi]]
- [[Nyctodromy]]

The [[House of the Moon]] is a strange reflection of the [[House of the Sun]], presided over by the [[The Meniscate]].

[[Killasimi]] could maybe be the native tongue of [[House of the Moon]]

Chilu notes:
- To enter [[House of the Moon]] [[Long]] have to commit their lives to the [[Moon]] by [[Nyctodromy]]
- It is uncertain whether [[House of the Moon]] and [[House of the Sun]] are reflections in a literal sense
	- It is possible that they are within different [[Histories]]
