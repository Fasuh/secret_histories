It is said that [[Mansus]] is a name referring to the invisible realm as a whole and to a specific region - [[House of the Sun]]. 

Mansus has no walls, its separated by the [[Wood]].

[[Edicts Liminal]] tells us how a city with a walls of shining [[Flint]] could be raised there.

Known locations within [[Mansus]]:
- [[Glory]]
- [[Concursum]]

Chilu notes:
- Since [[Mansus]] can be referring to both invisible realm and a specific region we could assume that the invisible realm is known as [[House of the Moon]] where the specific region is known as [[House of the Sun]]
	- This somewhat could make sense since [[House of the Moon]] is a reflection of [[House of the Sun]]
