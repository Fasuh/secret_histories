The [[The Meniscate]] is one of the [[Hours]], created from the division of the [[Sun-in-Splendour]] by the [[Forge of Days]]. She was acknowledged even before that event as a Name, the Sun’s “night-self”. Her face is a wounded mirror, and she presides over the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/places 1/House of the Moon]], the “shadow-self” of the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/places 1/Mansus]]. Her aspects are: [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Moon]], [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Knock]], [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Lantern]]
