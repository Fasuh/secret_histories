[[The Thunderskin]] was flayed by [[The Red Grail]] in order to gain favor of [[The Horned-Axe]], for her to help [[The Red Grail]] fight for the aspect of the [[Heart]].

[[The Orchid Transfigurations Birth]] seems to be portraying the death of [[The Thunderskin]].

He is known for being a musician originally.

Loved [[The Red Grail]] before loving [[Ring-Yew]].

Chilu notes:
- [[Dr Arun Peel]] is his herald
- Possibly [[Ramsund]] could portray the killing of [[The Thunderskin]]
	- [[Ramsund]] mentions seven birds, one of which is described as glitter-winged.
	- [[Ramsund]] describes that the glitter-winged bird was stripped from his wings and droven from the sky, which fits [[The Thunderskin]].
