[[The Thunderskin]] was flayed by [[The Red Grail]] in order to gain favor of [[The Horned-Axe]], for her to help [[The Red Grail]] fight for the aspect of the [[Heart]].

its an [[Hours|Hour]] who faces both ways at every threshold.

[[The Orchid Transfigurations Noon]] seems to be implying that [[The Horned-Axe]] is considering options to fight against people who want to kill her. 

[[Sisterhood of the knot]] seems to serve [[The Horned-Axe]] along [[Ring-Yew]] and [[The Red Grail]].

Chilu notes:
- They could be an [[Hours|Hour]] of the [[Moth]] since a [[Moth]] looks like an axe with its wings, and its anntenae could be considered horns.
- [[Horns & Ivories]] mentiones that [[Moth]] has horns.
