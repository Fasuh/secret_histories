"The precepts of limitation and division; established by the enigmatic conclave of [[Hours]] sometimes called the [[Chancel of the Hours|Chancel]]."

"The [[gods-who-are]], which we call the [[Hours]],"
- [[Maggephene Mysteries]]

Hours seem to be the gods of this world, they reign over [[Histories]]. Interestingly, it seems that not all [[Hours]] are equal. 

We can group [[Hours]] to specific groups:
- [[gods-who-are]]
- [[gods-from-Nowhere]]
- [[Gods-who-were-stone]]
- [[gods-from-stone]]
- [[gods-who-were-flesh]]
- [[gods of flesh and blood]]
- [[gods-from-Light]]
- [[gods-who-were-light]]

It seems that the groups were born in different periods, for example [[gods-from-stone]] are mostly basic objects like [[Flint]] or [[Wheel]], where [[gods-who-are]] are more complex ideas like [[Rose]] or [[Grail]].

[[Hours]] also seem to be fighting against each other, the most known conflict so far is [[Lithomachy]], where [[gods-who-are]] battled against [[gods-from-stone]].

Chilu notes:
- There is more than 24 [[Hours]].
