# Conversation

>Something in the clouds above the Evening Isles, they say...
>I have sisters in the clouds above the Evening Isles. I think the monks of St Tentreto would know to avoid their attentions. And so I think there must be something else up there - something new, or old. I should inform myself before I travel to the Isles..
# Questions

## Can you tell me about echidna?
>She is quite a curious one, she serves the gods from stone, more than anyone else out of all of us, she believes they may come back, she believes that with the help of an hour that she thretenizes with, will make an age unseen ever yet before and she is quite angry at the gods from light.
## Aren't the Gods from Light in the same Nowhere that the Gods from Stone are?
>One of them is. The Forge of Days still exist and the wretched spawn of the divided Sun still roam.
## Can you tell me what Hours have the principle of winter?
