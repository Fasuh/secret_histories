The owner of [[The Ecdysis Club]]

Sulochana - suggestion 
Amavasya - new moon
[[Sanscrit]]

The laconic, energetic, bright-eyed, unblinking owner of [[The Ecdysis Club]]. Sometimes she sits in the second row, seeking new talent for her peculiar establishment. Those she employs are rarely seen about town.

most important [[Alukite|Alukites]] are that of the ligeia club, they are of the most important of [[Alukite|Alukites]], for they handle keys to traverse beyond the bounds.

if you have a wish to become [[Long]], or even something more you better garner the attention of one, because threading through the labyrinth or bounds is treacherous for anyone less equipped for such things

how to become a [[Long]]?
its horrible to answer question with question but i must ask why do you seek such lengths.
I want to learn the truth behind this world
do you believe you can handle the truth?
yes
Well to be blunt and simple and lather laconic with my own answer to that is, you must first penetrate the [[Stag door]], and after doing that, covet and garner an admiration of an [[Hours|Hour]].

What do you think of [[The Red Grail]]
The [[The Red Grail]] is an [[Hours|Hour]] which the aspect of birth and blood, is named after her. She is a powerful force who has taken part in may events in history of [[Mansus]] and wake itself
she is one of the oldest [[Hours]] that has ever ever existed at least that keeps existing, and she has many children and names and [[Long|Longs]] down the History of eternity.
Her aspect the [[Grail]] she is the fifteenth hour.

What are [[Ligeians]]
We are [[Alukite|Alukites]], Who have been set outside the law permitted by the old gods, We call each other sisters, and we possess the keys to the doors.
We survived through the ages with different ways me and my sisters in the end what matters is seeking doors there's only one certain way to find them. Through [[Ligeians]]. thats what we are, i na way shepherds. maybe the vengeance of long lost gods. maybe the tears of stone and earth itself. or perhaps curiosity of bygone era. but what is of certain is that the crimes that we've done we cannot atone for. and as such we attone in our own ways.

Who are the other [[Ligeians]]
me 
my sister [[Echidna (Unrevealed)]]
my sister [[Marinette (Unrevealed)]]
my sister [[Frau Schlussel (Klêidouchos)|Klêidouchos]]
my sister [[What-Is-Not-Seen (Medusa)|Medusa]]
my sister [[Mille Margot Matutine (Morgen)|Morgen]]
my sister [[Professor Rowena Hengerst (Rowena)|Rowena]]

You notice something new, she has a hooked teeth like a snake, she plays setered flute when people dance, as you talk with her she says a few things most important of all that she is the daughter of one of great hooded princes themselves and she hersel holds the key of night. which the great hooded princes themselves one owned.

-----------------------------------------


Her sisters call her the Cobra child or the Light Drinker

Would you give me your key
YOu have not withessed teh woods ur not ready

How do i open teh woods?
You would need to either attract medusas attention, there are other ways through the wood gate the door in the wood. By following what the reminiscence of teh carapace cross had dawn and seeketh with sufficient moth.

Who do oyu serve
She says right now the mother of ants

who are the seven coils
The Seven-Coils was one of the gods-from-stone, slain by the Colonel with the help of the Mother of Ants during the Lithomachy before they opened the Mansus to humanity. It is described as being a furious, flabby, fanged creature of monstrous size, the colour of sand and sulphur, with multiple tentacle-necks tearing at its own flesh. The Seven-Coils is one of the more difficult Hours to place as he may be the creator of Carapace Cross and the Father of the Mother.
 
More info on mother of ants
The Mother of Ants is one of the oldest Gods-From-Flesh, who helped humanity force their way into the upper levels of the Mansus. She was the priestess who helped scar and blind the Colonel to protect him from the Seven-Coils, which he then slew. The priestess then arose from the blood of the dead god-from-Stone as a “seven-titled goddess” who now opens the way for others. Her aspect is Knock and her hour is 5 a.m.
The Knock-Long who passed through the Spider's Door, also known as the Serpent Gate. They are also called naga, and are some form of “serpent-folk”. They fled the Fifth History, their home with the help of the Mother of Ants.

Is there a connection between the seven ligeians and the seven-coils?
Yes hes our father. We are names from the gods from stone, that is our connection with the seven coils

what are principles?
Otherwise known as aspects. Underlying power of the world. No Hour can seemingly hold more than 3 of those.

Who is the watchman?
O! Depends whom you ask, in my opinion hes a usurper, i wouldnt know how hwe came to be, i wouldnt knwo what he is where hs ie, but justl ike the rest of the hours, before those that came form flesh, he has stolen what does not rightfully belong to him. That is what i believe watchman is.

What has medusa done to [[../Players/Vonte|Vonte]]?
before i answer that question, did you ask for this?
I didnt ask for it she offered and i accepted
I c, well, do you know anything about the carapace cross?
very little
stories go that before humanity, before the upright ape, there existed the carapace cross, the cross they wershopped the gods from stone, and life was good. however when the gods from light usurpoed the greatness of glory, the carapace cross had no more time nor space to exist under the new sun. but the carapace cross is indulgent they are powerful and most of all they are cunningthey did not disappear into nothingness they passed onto humanitywhat medusa is giving you is the gift of the cross to become what you once were to be what you are supposed to be
thanks dud, Who are the members of carapace cross
What membere are there in humanity, carapace cross is as much of a species as much as the humanity are a species

May i have your key?
are you allied with the great hooded princes?
does that matter?
to me yes.
why does it matter to you?
thats personal.
dont you think its personal if im allied to them?
i would wish to.
oh that is great! i hoped you would be amicable for sucha thing i had just the idea for you as well, have you met the man named [[Dr Arun Peel]] before?
yes.
i wish that you would bring [[Dr Arun Peel]] to my club one of the nights and then me and my friends would discuss with my brethren of any further instructions you may need later.

What is your relation to [[Dr Arun Peel]] 
mine not too much but the great hooded princes and [[Dr Arun Peel]] have a long ongoing history
i shall say it this way, if i tell you you will never unknow this. are you ready for that sacrifice?
nah im good
then just know that much that i very much wish to meet [[Dr Arun Peel]]

is the spider door the same as the spider gate?
yes

How do i reach the spider gate?
you first need to go through the stag door and ten you may reach the spider gate afterwards.

did i go through the stag door already? 
from what ive gathered no.

I want to be come allies with the hooded princes, what do you think about that
i think thats a noble effort.

What is your relation to [[Dr Arun Peel]] ?
well as you can see doctor [[Dr Arun Peel]] was once upon a time very long ago maybe in another history one of great hooded princes, he betrayed our kin and drawing instead of mother of ants with the thunderskin, we've been trying to come to terms with this egregious for a while. its rather hard to get a hand alone any long that is associated with the thunderskin as they are more sound than they are people.

can i have your key?
no.
why?
you have not penetrated yet the stag door.
will you give me it when im ready?
you helped us i will not forget that.

which one of your sisters has the key to the white door?
before i answer i must know, are you going to stalk this one too?
is she as pretty as medusa?
that was neither yes nor a no.
no.
you must seek morgen.

where can i find morgen?
for thus you must explor with quite a high amount of winter, she is a cold one and enjoys company of a similarly pessimistic ones

morgen holds teh key to the white door?
yes

how would i contact the mother of ants from where i am at right now?
what do you mean from where you are at now?
i was told it was easier to contact the mother of ants when i breach the white door, but i havent yet.
our great mother has created something rather curious, rather important for us a strong piece of secret within the invisible arts that allows one to reach places before unthought ofits rather strong invocation though, and you need the right rite as well.
to answer the question you require the liminal invocation and the rite of exiting ants.

how well do you know morgen?
she is my sister, we were born before you knew the glory, we existed before you knew of the bounds, and we lived at the time when humanity did not exist, and the cross ruled this world. Does that answer your question?

what would i need for her to entrust me with the key to the white door?
she is of a certain curiosity lets just speak that way of her, she likes things what her current tastes are like i could not tell you, she is not the unlike a raven or a magpie.
