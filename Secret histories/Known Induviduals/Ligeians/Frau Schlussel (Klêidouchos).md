# Conversation

>A spry, forceful woman in severe black and white, tightly wrinkled. She is observed never to blink. A tiny black puppy peeps from her skirts.

>Today, I have not eaten you. What do you want? Be quick. I have little use for this any more. You might. Do not drink it.

# Questions

## Is the door in the Eye Vak?
>No, absolutely not, he is the watchman.
## Then who is Vak?
>That gets complicated child, Vak is the peacock door, the gate of eyes and prides dismay, Vak is the goddess of language. She allowed us to become greater later
## Can you tell me about the watchman?
>well he is a mercilles hour of knowledge and enlightment its believed that he wass once an unwise mortal who learned teh ways of flint and ascended under a hattrick? its true though what he is now is well beyond everyones comprehension, and nobody truly knows what he wishes to accomplish, especially after he ascended onto his current place, onto the sun in splendour. Crazy! 
## Where is the City of Mia?
>It is the cursed city swallowed by the desert, by the fate given by [[The Vagabond]] herself. She was from the city herself, that has made her unwanted within its boundaries and as such, forgotten. Forever. But not in the invisible world. A lot of secrets remain within that city. A lot of secrets only wanderers and pilgrims may realise.
## What invisible arts are you proficient with?
>[[Rose]] and [[Knock]] is what i reside in.
## What is the nature of the invisible arts?
>The nature is quite obvious in some places. in others they are rather curious, but to not talk in riddles, lkemme(?) say it this way the invisible arts is what you make out them you found them in [[Snow Stories]], you've come around asking the very foudation of earth where it led you using [[Birdsong]] using rumours of the winds the invisible arts are power of the invisible.....|... is what dwells within what allows one to become [[long]] and know and if you become proficient enough in invisible arts you may even be worthy to be a [[Names|Name]].
>and i may not or rather should not be saying this but there is always a chance no matter how miniscule that if you know enough of the invisible arts you may usurp an [[Hours|Hour]] itself for yourself. that is what the invisible arts are, power unmitigated beyond imagination and beyond boundaries, that is why the [[Mansus]] has no walls.
## Whats the name of your dog?
>Dog
## Im looking for [[The Vagabond]]
>Are you that spry fold who has visited the roost the other day?
>Maybe
>Maybe I just find it rather yknow brave to try to visit the one who decided not to obliterate you, well i must sadly tell you you have arrived tiny bit too late, and by tiny bit i mean years late, its not too much time if you are a long ofc, and you are trying to be a long right?
>yes
>how badly?
>i did go to the roost didnt i?
>and yet you are conversing and thretenizing with my sister medusa, curious
>well you would know that she has a temperament, and you too know as well that she is in cachoots with a certain hour in the woods if i think rightly?
>no
>well you will know later, what im saying is, which do you prefer? the smiting of medusa? the glare of the moth, or the potential of the vagabond?
>the vagabond.
>if you are so true about that, why dont you visit me later with one of your believers, if oyu wish to show devotion to the vagabond, after that we'll see, you still need to be acquire some logevity. but i will tell you this much, whatever rancor you show i shall not help you with.
>who would be angry?
>youll find out.
## Given her [[Renira]] 
>I didnt thought you have it in you young one, do remember, this road will be a tenious one for you, and i shall not protect whatever comes out of you
>So you wish to meet [[The Vagabond]]?
>>Yeah
>Take this: [[Petition for a Labirynth Season]] you have to unravel it, you have to make this petition for her to visit you. Now i have one more question for you - Are you prepared?
>>Im on a tight schedule so yes
## What do i need for [[Rite of the Musician's Sacrifice]]?
>Are you sure you wish to use that? You know what happened in musician sacrifice, you have to flay someone, their flaying should protect you if appropriate incantation has been given. You seem to be okay taking lives so that is all.
## Why is [[Vagabond's map]] [[Nectar]]
>She probably visited France, she visits all kinds of places, probably writes what grabbed her in those places. There is no rhyme or reason why her fragments are as they are child
## How do i upgrade this lady further? [[Clovette]]
>Are you talking on rose? i would keep at it.
