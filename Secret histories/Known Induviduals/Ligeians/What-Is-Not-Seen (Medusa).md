## What does it do?
>Before I answer why do you care now?
>>I live in a moment
>Then it matters not really

## Can I have your Key?
Why you already have penetrated the woods.

## How do I progress further into the [[Mansus]]?
The best way is to keep exploring deeper and deeper with secrets uncover
an easier way of course is to gain the attention of an hour and guide you through it
but I wouldn't trust them, they are capricious

## What made you commit the crime of the sky?
It is merely a nature that we possess, no matter how much time and ages pass it is insatiable, it is unpredictable, it is inevitable However our crimes were not done out of leisure, but after its done might as well continue and accept the change

## What is your relation to the gods from nowhere
Not much, I heard that who once we served are now are part of their entourage better way to say it things were born from their corpses in nowhere, they have changed, irrecoverably, but they may rise one day still

>>knowledge
>what will you do with it
>>idk until I get it
>why don't you seek knowledge from the earth
>>what do you think the well is
>she points upwards

>>hands a hanger-on
>that's not a bad start, 
>*gained patronage* 

why didn't you want my [[Kull]]
because you already changed I cannot change it further

you said I should look to the ground can you be more specific?
the ground holds mysteries, the past, its from the ground where the great gods of old have risen form, and it is where they shall rise again. 

may i have the key now?
It would be useless to you now
have you penetrated the white gate?
We are the key.

What would it take for you to give me the key?
penetrate the white gate

if your key is useless to me how do i get past the passage in the well?
your body is not yet ready, your change has begun but has not yet ended.

what may be lost?
its not yours to ask.

who are the hours related to scale?
of course, it is the moth, the door in the eye. the horned axe, the vagabond, and if you would dare to consider it, the snow itself.

can you tell me about the vagabond?
the vagabond she is a rogue hour, barred from ever entering the mansus for the future act that she still has to commit she wanders everywhere else though even nowhere, and claims knowledge of all histories, that has yet to be and will ever be.
she knows her own crime?
that i cannot say. the vagabond is the hour of 5pm and her aspects are rose moth and scale

how can i get in contact with the vagabond?
you feel uneasy for a bit. but then before anything she asks
why?
maybe they can help me upon the path of change (scale).
why would you think that?
they are scale.
if you wish to satiate your curiosity with lesser crosses, then you should penetrate the white gate, and enter the lodge of the sage knight. there you will find some answers.
