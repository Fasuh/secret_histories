Questions

What does it do?
Before i answer why do you care now?
I live in a moment
Then it matters not really

Can i have your Key?
Why you already have penetrated the woods.

How do i progress further into the [[Mansus]]?
The best way is to keep exploring deeper and deeper with secrets uncover
an easier way of course is to gain the attention of an hour and guide you through it
but i wouldnt trust them, they are capricious

What made you commit the crime of the sky?
It is merely a nature that we posess, no matter how much time and ages pass it is insatiable, it is unpredictable, it is inevitable However our crimes were not done out of leisure, but after its done might as well continue and accept the change

What is your relation to the gods from nowhere
Not much, i heard that who once we served are now are part of their antarage better way to say it things were born from their corpses in nowhere, they have changed, irrecoverably, but they may rise one day still

Can i have your key?
to what end?
to get to the secret passage in the well
i know why you want to use it i want to knwo why you want it
to open the door
to what end
the door being open
you have no plan
ofc i do
what is it
i wish to travel to the moon place and talk to an hour
you are part of the woods now, your changing irracoverably whats the point in travelling further up, accept your fate and become one with the cross,
i have to do somethign in the meantime
why u arent just waiting and doing nothing
because i eat people, rather a better question is what do you seek higher up in the mansus when everything is pulling you up to the ground, 
knowledge
what will you do with it
idk until i get it
why dont you seek knowledge from the earth
what do you think the well is
 she points upwards
then i shall ask one final thing, what could your offer be for my key
hands a hanger-on
thats not a bad start, 
gained patronage 

why didnt you want my kull
because you already changed i cannot change it further

you said i should look to the ground can you be more specific?
the ground holds mysteries, the past, its from the ground where the great gods of old have risen form, and it is where they shall rise again. 

may i have the key now?
It would be useless to you now
have you penetrated the white gate?
We are the key.

What would it take for you to give me the key?
penetrate the white gate

if your key is useless to me how do i get past the passage in the well?
your body is not yet ready, your change has begun but has not yet ended.

what may be lost?
its not yours to ask.

who are the hours related to scale?
of course, it is the moth, the door in the eye. the horned axe, the vagabond, and if you would dare to consider it, the snow itself.

can you tell me about the vagabond?
the vagabond she is a rogue hour, barred from ever entering the mansus for the future act that she still has to commit she wanders everywhere else though even nowhere, and claims knowledge of all histories, that has yet to be and will ever be.
she knows her own crime?
that i cannot say. the vagabond is the hour of 5pm and her aspects are rose moth and scale

how can i get in contact with the vagabond?
you feel uneasy for a bit. but then before anything she asks
why?
maybe they can help me upon the path of change (scale).
why would you think that?
they are scale.
if you wish to satiate your curiosity with lesser crosses, then you should penetrate the white gate, and enter the lodge of the sage knight. there you will find some answers.
