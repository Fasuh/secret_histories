Mistress of a successor prince, and wife of an exiled one. Rumored to have birthed four children, some of whom became part of the nobility in Sweden. Unpredictable, manipulative, and uncivilised. As a lover, she is often adulterous. Her chaotic agenda is not clear, maybe even to herself.

I lost my eye in the woods when i was but a simple know, every year tho at candlemice i return to the woods to visit the eye that i have lost.
I learned of places that almost no has kgotten before and sometimes i left those places that dont exist anymore i guess thats folyl of the woods oitself sometimes i feel more like am oth than its nectar.
writing Names to places where they wont be found

Do you know a place with sufficient power of bosk but not too much?
have you visited crowkissed hills yet?
no where is it
Maybe you should.

Can i visit your eye?
you could.

Do you know about a secret that has been hidden?
she very directly says if i would know that has been hidden it would not be hidden anymore.

who do you serve?
She serves the Malachite

Can you tell me more about malachite?
ah yes, teh malachite, the thunderskins old lover, the one who the thunderskin sacrificed himself to. but the malachite or as some of other followers would refer ring yew, she instead chose to be a relationship after that flaying with no other mayor in the tree, it is the relationship that is most forbidden and whimsical even in the standards of hours. and ofc she is the one who is worshipped alongside the red grail and horned axe within the sisterhood of the knot. Her principles are moth grail and heart. its the hour of 3AM

If you had to look fo a secret that has been hidden where would you start
in places forgotten even by the hours, or by the long themselves. or maybe i would just write a secret, because the best preserved secrets are ones that are yet to be written.
