# Conversation

>Mistress of a successor prince, and wife of an exiled one. Rumored to have birthed four children, some of whom became part of the nobility in Sweden. Unpredictable, manipulative, and uncivilised. As a lover, she is often adulterous. Her chaotic agenda is not clear, maybe even to herself.

>I lost my eye in [[Way The Wood|The Woods]] when i was but a simple know, every year tho at candlemice i return to the woods to visit the eye that i have lost.
>I learned of places that almost no one has gotten to before and sometimes i left those places that don't exist anymore i guess that's folyl of the woods itself sometimes i feel more like am [[Moth]] than its [[Nectar]].
>writing [[Names]] to places where they wont be found

## Questions

## Do you know a place with sufficient power of [[The Bosk]] but not too much?
>have you visited [[Crowkiss Hill]] yet? 
>Me: no where is it
>Maybe you should.
## Can i visit your eye?
>you could.
## Do you know about a secret that has been hidden?
>she very directly says if i would know that has been hidden it would not be hidden anymore.
## who do you serve?
>She serves [[Ring-Yew|The Malachite]]
## Can you tell me more about [[Ring-Yew|The Malachite]]?
>ah yes, [[Ring-Yew|The Malachite]], [[The Thunderskin]] old lover, the one who [[The Thunderskin]] sacrificed himself to. but [[Ring-Yew|The Malachite]] or as some of other followers would refer [[Ring-Yew]], she instead chose to be a relationship after that flaying with no other mayor in the tree, it is the relationship that is most forbidden and whimsical even in the standards of [[Hours]]. and ofc she is the one who is worshipped alongside [[The Red Grail]] and [[The Horned-Axe]] within the [[sisterhood of the knot]]. Her principles are [[Moth]] [[Grail]] and [[Heart]]. its the [[Hours|Hour]] of 3AM
## If you had to look for a secret that has been hidden where would you start
>in places forgotten even by the [[Hours]], or by the long themselves. or maybe i would just write a secret, because the best preserved secrets are ones that are yet to be written.
## Are you an edge long?
>No
## i know someone who died, i wish to bring them back to life, i heard malachite is capable of doing such thing?
>the malachite can do many miracles, but those miracles are reserved for her own, mayhaps you should give yourself a bit to the malachite and then you may gain some of those favors for your friend ofc
## In that case how do i contact the malachite?
>you must traverse teh woods, and should you do so, contact her with grail
## i assume because your principle is visibly nectar, do you contact her via nectar?
>No
## any conflicts of interest with twins?
>i hope you realize her company is in less than stellar relationship with the twins, but i wouldnt dare to believe anything of the malachite whether she has or has not a problem with them
## What is your favourite book?
>[[Huldra's Cookbook]]
