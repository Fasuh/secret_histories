## there is one topic i dont understand fully, what is the relation between [[Calyptra]] and watchman?
>that is a very curious question, lemme explain, It is associalted with the watchmans tree, otherwise known as the great storehous of knowledge, the covenant of the road, the watchmant tree are libraries fruits of knowledge, knowledge that has to be kept safe secret well, you know like the places like hush house, the invisiible serapioum the yeshiva tigris, the tomb of lies, crossrow, the grove of grain immortals, the house haustorium, the labirynth of lions, and finally the monastery of the fifth cup, these are the watchmans tree, and calyptra are responsible for enforcing the law that some knowledge goes outside of these libraries, knowledges that people cannot garner, unless they pass thru the stag door, that is why calyptra exists, it is an enforcement.

>white one is [[Madrugad]], red one is the mare in teh [[Mare-in-the-Tree]], the black one is the moldiwarp, [[The Velvet]].
## I cannot help but notice that you kidna dont liek calyptra, is there a reason for that?
>i have no problem with general notion of calyptra, some of them is very rightful and righteous,look at [[Madrugad]], he is very important, he acquires wisdom. Or look at rather curious of a choice but maybe understandable [[Mare-in-the-Tree]], the fire fueld by truth the temptation of suffering itself, very imporatant lessions, but then night unwounded, the doom and geist the one that hsdes secrets, from being spoke, or revealed although i understand and agree that some secrets are not to be found, those secrets should not be forgo'en.
## can you tell me more about [[Mare-in-the-Tree]]?
>a too too much to say, she is ofc the god from nowhere, and she is a friendly sorts, to get you to do what she wishes to do, foer scrupioulous reasons, but she is a rather useful lil things and ofc theres that whole thing that her love for the malachite and those things, but that matters little to calyptra, she is a useful hour to keep the very notion of truth alive, she is the 25th hours, and her principles, are knock, moth and forge,
