# Questions

## What rite would you use to do the [[A Delightful Sacrament|A Delightful Sacrament]]
>Depends how much blood you want?
>Me: one thing to heal
>no no i ain't talking about healing i'm talking about bloodshed here, how much blood you want to share.
>Me: as little as possible but only for the sake of efficiency
>[[Rite of the Beast's Division|Rite of the Beast's Division]] would suit you better, much less blood.
## Lets say just to indulge, lets see we went another end what rite would that be and what would be the difference
>In beast division u use words to kill
>in [[Rite of the Crucible Soul|Rite of the Crucible Soul]] u use something sharp, you need a tool for that.
## The [[Rite of the Crucible Soul|Rite of the Crucible Soul]] and the [[A Delightful Sacrament|A Delightful Sacrament]] can i use it to heal another person?
>I don't see why you would but you could.
