Rakehell, dilettante, infuriating prodigy. Possibly dead, possibly real.

what rite would you use to do the [[A Delightful Sacrament|A Delightful Sacrament]]
depends how much blood you want?
one thing to heal
no no i aint talking about healing im talking about bloodshed here,
how much blood you want to share.
as little as possible but only for the sake of efficiency [[Rite of the Beast's Division|Rite of the Beast's Division]] would suit you better, much less blood.

lets say just to indulge, lets see we went another end what rite would that be and what would be the difference
in beast division u use words to kill
in [[Rite of the Crucible Soul|Rite of the Crucible Soul]] u use something sharp, you need a tool for that.

The [[Rite of the Crucible Soul|Rite of the Crucible Soul]] and the [[A Delightful Sacrament|A Delightful Sacrament]] can i use it to heal another person?
i dont see why you would but you could.

Can teach:
- [[Deep Mandaic]]
