# Conversation

>There are 5 [[Histories]], barely anyone can interact with them [[Alexander the Great]] spoke about how to reach from one end to other. Hooded princes, things that in time you will realize. 

>in the day of the [[Lithomachy]] when [[gods-from-stone]] have fought with [[gods of flesh and blood]]they finally were able to utilize that weapon, the weapon of the words, and that is how we [[Long]] were able to become that which may crawl up beyond [[The Bounds]] and the [[Wood]]s and [[Knock]] at the [[Peacock Door]].

>You know that immortals - [[Long]] - can't have children. Bad things happen if they try. What if a pre-immortal had children? Would there be anything special about those? [[Ivory Dawn]] likes to think so. I like to think not. And if I say anything more about that, I'll start to feel like a fool.

 >I can't imagine how anyone might begin to heal their flesh. But if they decided he wants to speak with me, I have some inkling now of what I might need to understand.
 
 >A patient of mine is troubled by a dream of a lake. He swims out, he dives, he is reborn beneath the moon… we identified it just last month as Gladywn Lake. He has never been there. He wants to go. And now, just now, I hear about this business of the Tapestry, and the rite.

>The best outcome, Librarian, seems to be that the rite involves the Hour named Applebright. The worst, that it involves the Crowned Growth. And both of these are Nowhere Hours. No one has ever been prepared to tell me what that really means, but I know enough not to roll around in it.

>St Columba of the Dove. There is a story that his coffin is here at Brancrug - one of the treasures of the House. Don't worry, I'm not going to ask about that. I respect the House's secrets. But I would like to know more about why he might have been brought here…

>Always the tide. I used to hear that, growing up, when my mother thought I wasn't listening.  'Always the tide…' Thank you, Librarian.
  
>Dr Southey, inspired by the stories of St Mihail's Coffin to look into the story of St Columba's sarcophagus, seemed to find what she sought. 'Always the tide,' she said...

# Questions
#### What is [[The Crime of the Sky|The crime of sky]]?
>[[The Crime of the Sky]] is a law of the House and the universe, which forbids immortal beings from consuming their offspring, lest they become monstrous beings known as [[Alukite|Alukites]]. However, the act of procreation makes the former almost inevitable, as the parents develop an irresistible urge to consume them. Even the [[Hours]] are subject to this danger, and so are forced to restrain their passions.
#### Is there any difference between [[Alukite]] and [[Ligeians|ligeian]]?
>Some would say no, but there is. The [[Ligeians]] are outside of the law
#### What are [[Worms|the Worms]]?
>[[Worms|The Worms]] are native inhabitants of [[Nowhere]]. There they feast upon and breed inside the bodies of dead [[Hours]], though they are always eager to leave and expand their feeding grounds. [[Worms|The Worms]] enter the Wake where the skin of the world is thinned, and then enter mortals (and perhaps not only mortals) through the spaces in their skin. Their insatiability poses an existential threat to reality, for it is said "if they complete their work, the [[Mansus]] will be [[Nowhere]], one day. They feast upon the [[Sun-in-Splendour|Sun-in-Splendour's]] and the [[Seven Coils|Seven-Coils]] body and breed upon them.
#### Who is the Coil Queen?
>The coil queen in many people consider that name to be ubiquitous with the heinous [[Ligeians|ligeian]] [[What-Is-Not-Seen (Medusa)|Medusa]].
#### Where to acquire passion?
>Passion is what you believe in most
#### How to contact Medusa?
>You may find her where statues reside most, you must travel, ask more travelled folk though. but from I know is where statues reside most is where she resides in.
#### What do you know about the Twins?
>The Twins curious question, my expertise is not of them, they are more.... woodsy, so to speak. But what i can tell is that they are indeed connected to the red grail, if i remember correctly, at one point at one point or another they were their name even. But more properly they are called the sister and witch or you may call them the witch and sister.
## Who are the hours of the aspect of moon
>Those who posess the aspects of the moon are the beachcomer, the illegeist, the madrugad, the mother of ants, 
>but when i spoke to you another time you said that meniscate was aligned with the moon
>its curious one her aspect her principle is not of the moon but she controls that of the moon the house of the moon that is as a reflection of the sun itself
## What is the difference between the principle and aspect?
> a principle you own its a part of you an aspect is a principle you can still use, for example you are high in the rose and rose and moon principle, yet you are still able to use winter
## can you tell me about the principles of the maniscate?
>She possesses the principle of lantern knock and forge?
## What are the principles of the mother of ants?
>her principles are of the moon rose and knock

## what ritual is required for the shaping chant
>the proper ritual is the one which sacrifices in the end its influence, those are the words that you have to part with

## Rite intercalate sunset or crow quenching which one consumes influence
>why would you ever use rite intercalate?
out of those 3 only one consumes or sacrifices its influence in the end and its the sunset rite
well technically intercalate works, it consumes all

## what exactly does this ritual change?
>depends how well the ritual works, it may merely change the body, it may change the very soul within you, it may change the invisible arts that you know, it depends how good you are, it has very little limitation but you must meet it with a lot of forge
