# Conversation

>One-time Librarian of Hush House, one-time Librarian of the Invisible Serapeum in Alexandria, and currently... what, exactly? Serena is close-mouthed, but I know that she has worked with the St Rhonwen Trust.

>Zidane is dead. It's a pity: the man was an artist. And it's concerning: I wonder if the death might not have something to do with his last work.

>He was already making use of some very unusual alloys - very unusual techniques. I'd like to use the collection to develop some theories further with his notes.

>I think Zidane might have been using [[Ys]]-metal in his work. That would upset quite a number of people, from the Bureau on downâ€¦. thank you, friend. I hope I can always trust you to keep our conversations confidential.

# Questions

## Where did Zidane die?
>He died in [[Budapest]]
## Where would one find remaining notes from the invisible Serapeum of Alexandria?
>Quite a curious question asked of a librarian, what do you need and i may be able to provide some of it.
## Why would working with [[Ys]] metal in particular upset people?
>Because it doesn't exist. It only exists because people believe it should exist not unlike the city unbuilt , everything of [[Ys]] is a fabrication of dreams that only exists because we dare to dream of them, and some unchecked dreaming can cause a lot of problem with the bureau
## Is [[Sunset Rite]] a right ritual to change (with [[A Shaping Chant]]) 
>yes, there are a couple
## Does it matter what rite we use?
>i prefer [[Rite of the Map's Edge|Rite of the Map's Edge]] its more fluid, requires less people
## What principles are required for that rite with [[A Shaping Chant|A Shaping Chant]]
>ofc [[Forge]], lots and lots of [[Forge]].
## How much [[Forge]] would be required to change a commitment in a skill?
>a wisdom?
>before i answer i must know for lets just say professional reasons, why would you want to change your wisdom?
>i seek the path of [[Preservation]] but earlier in my studies i accidentally delved in the path of [[Nyctodromy]] and i wish to change that particular ability to [[Preservation]].
>i see. i would highly recommend using [[Iotic Essence]] while you are delving in that rite, it gives you quite a bit of head start to deal with such an erratic change, but i should be amiss to not tell you this, the [[hours]] are watching you now, and changing history so curiously may raise attention.
## I have a friend of my that wishes to know more about [[Forge|Forge]] [[Hours]] 
>ofc, there is without the doubt the [[Forge of Days]] herself, then [[The Lion-Smith]], if [[The Lion-Smith]] is not something of your level, and you wish to forge more reliant on the dead then [[Madrugad]] should help you, if not [[Madrugad]] then it should be the [[Meniscate]], then if not [[Meniscate]] then perhaps you are lost
