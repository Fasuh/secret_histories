# Conversation

>He is a hero, pilgrim, traitor. He'll always be a soldier, but never again can he be only a soldier.

>If Death's direction is down, and Eternity's is up, which directions do we assign to Life and to History? It is a frequent topic of discussion, at the Labyrinth. I wonder, sometimes, if my teachers have nothing better to do with all those years of learning... but in the Labyrinth, more than any other place I have been, even Emesa, Sun and Stone and Silence are the first constants.
