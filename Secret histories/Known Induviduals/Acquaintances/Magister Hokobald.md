# Conversation

> Metallurgist, gourmet, corrupted immortal. And, supposedly, a long-ago king's by-blow.

>Some cretin is attempting to stage the Invisible Opera in Venice. Well, I suppose if anything catches fire, Venice is less inclined than most cities to burn. When the production fails - and it will - I wish to take full advantage of the situation. Do not concern yourself with the details. I have all the details at my command apprentice.

# Questions

## Anything about [[The Mother of Ants]]?
>why would you want to know something like that?
>Me: because u told me i would need a help from [[The Mother of Ants]] and i don't want to help from a [[Ligeians|Ligeian]]
>i like it, 
>im not the best person to do this. are you gonna know about the ol [[The Mother of Ants|Mother of Ants]], she is the daugher of the father. the daughter of venims? saint agnims herself, and all the hooded princes are from her lineage. at least in some shape or form, interconnected. Them serpentfolk are rather obnoxious abt the fact that our good ol mommy is always watching over them. otherwise if the stories of eld are to be believed she is the one who helped the [[The Colonel|Colonel]] ascend to the prestigious position that he is right now. but otherwise idk too much about her either.
## If not through [[The Mother of Ants]] how did you ascend?
>well i didnt say i didnt ascend through her, i did but more off through her children, i was one of The Ordo Limiae im p sure i was the only man in The Ordo Limiae back then
>i was part of The Ordo Limiae but you know, things came around, appetites rose and i may have dabbled with [[The Crime of the Sky]], now because of that i started making connections and one thing led to the other and [[Sulochana Amavasya]] graciously showed me a few curious paths in [[Mansus]] end and [[The Malleary]], was ready to receive me
>u understand [[Forge]] is not merely for crafting weapons or light or steel or fancy weapons unbreakable cages etc.... no, we as [[Forge]] could craft better things than any of [[The Velvet]] or [[Ring-Yew|The Malachite]] could ever, those forbidden fruits lead to quite a recipee
## When i get through the spider gate would you show me the way through [[The Malleary]]
>if, sure.
## How do i contact mother of ants from [[Way The Wood]]?
>you must talk with [[Sulochana Amavasya]], that's the easiest way to do it.
>Me: i didn't ask for easy
>the hard way is to somehow penetrate through the gate itself without asking for permission.
## What should i do when i dream about [[White Door|The White Door]]?
>look around enjoy it, it is the only pausible place that you can enjoy left in the [[Mansus]], other than [[The Malleary]] ofc, theres a lot of knowledge that you can get after you penetrate it. it should prepare you for the ascension.
>should the knowledge or the door prepare me for the ascension?
>the knowledge.
>[[White Door]] isn't as thicc as people claim to be
## Can you list Hours with the principle of [[Forge]]?
>Ofc we must start with the [[Forge of Days]], then ofc is [[The Lion-Smith]] as well, also we couldnt besmurtch [[Madrugad]] either or [[Meniscate]], ifm y memory serves right those are all the [[Forge]]
## Can you tell me more about the [[Forge of Days]]?
>She is one of the original gods from light who descended from [[Secret Histories/Locations/Not (yet) Visitable/Glory|Glory]], she is of destructive change from which the aspect from the [[Forge]] takes its name from, and she is the primary hour governing that principle, she was worshipped once as some zoroestrian deity as well during the day but through the history she was [[Mansus]] life, and the balance of power within it, you know her perhaps from the intercalate when she she was divided the [[Sun-in-Splendour]], to prevent him from having children from their love, and of course, her principles are of the [[Forge]], the [[Sky]] and [[Edge]] 8PM is her hour.
## Can you tell me more about the [[The Colonel|Colonels]] path
>Curious question, i am not the best one to ask about it but from i know the path he took is the slaying of the [[Seven Coils|Seven-Coils]] and the the battering of the what we know as [[The Spider Gate]] open so the humanity may enter deeper into the [[Mansus]], that is the path he took to become as feared as he is within the [[Mansus]], idk more of it, i do know one thing maybe that may interest you have you heard that he had help? [[The Mother of Ants|Mother of Ants]]! and together they rose to be [[Hours]] afterwards
## Did you follow his path? 
>If you are willing and your path leads you through [[The Spider Gate]] then you will be following his path as well i'd assume.
## The bookstore in oriflamme is getting light on [[Forge]] are there other good places to expand my [[Forge]] knowledge?
>Sadly not
## How do i find [[The Spider Gate]]?
>You need to find spill blood within the [[Ascend of Knives]] of course
## Where is the [[Ascend of Knives]]
>The [[Ascend of Knives]], that is beyond [[The Stag Door]], it is mostly used by [[The Watchman]] himself, that is the one who decides if you go to the [[Sun-In-Rags]] or the [[Meniscate]], or somewhere a bit further
## Do i have to perform a rite that spills blood to ascent higher or simply spill blood?
>how else would you spill blood?
## What wisdoms does the [[Forge of Days]] subscribe?
>Curious question, [[Ithastry]] and [[Horomachistry]]
## How do i find and get beyond [[The Stag Door]]?
>Well if you dont seek key may as well talk with [[Ghirbi]], he is easy to find, he is always at [[The Stag Door|The Stag Gate]], if you answer his riddle he opens [[The Stag Door]]
## How do i find [[The Stag Door]]?
>it shouldn't be too too hard, im gonna be honest, merely you must acquire something its called a [[Vagabond's map]], if you use her map behind [[White Door|The White Gate]], you should find [[The Stag Door]], 
## Asking for a map of doors
![[Pasted image 20240728224110.png]]
## How do i answer [[Ghirbi]]'s Riddle when i cant speak behind [[White Door|The White Door]]?
>Well did you find [[Lore Fragments|Secrets]] through your journey?
>Are you familiar with the smith secret? or ardent orisen? [[A Shaping Chant]]?
>Oh then you are familiar with these [[Lore Fragments|Secrets]] these secrets of knowledge that can live on their own, you can talk beyond the white door with those things
>Imagine them like living words, words spoken without the need of mouth
## Does [[Ghirbi]] always ask the same riddle?
>No he has many riddles
## Explain more about the [[Vagabond's map]]
>there is not much to explain about, it is a hidden knowledge, that allows us to look for hidden places, forgotten places. You know am quite certain that you know about shadowless empire. You could use that map to maybe find where it was once upon a time located. The map is used only for that, to locate hard to find things, forgotten things, secret things.
## How to find [[Vagabond's map]]?
>those maps are quite curious sometimes they pop out from nowhere, the best thing i can say is look for [[Rose]] [[Lore Fragments|Secrets]] you may find some answers within those [[Lore Fragments|Living Words]]
## Whats the worst that could happen when eating a child without a crime of the sky
>Its easy you turn into Soucouyant
## What is Soucouyant
>Well it is something that an alukite becomes when they cannot conserve their hunger anymore, they get out of their own skin, very powerful
## Who do you serve?
>ofc, i of all things serve the forge of days
## how would i raise a tool from the dead?
>that is more of a winter question, maybe ask people about medrugod, he used to be rather fond of those dead things, or meniscate even, she has an army of them, or was it the sun in rags, i dont quite remember
## How would i raise a tool from living?
>You can forge tools form many materials, i myself cant know how a tool can be fasioned form a living, sounds rather avantgarde, maybe you are thinking more of what lionsmith does i guess, could ask edge people of those creations, beasts are tools as well dont you think.
## Can i appease the forge of days after using [[A Shaping Chant]]
>You can appease anyone, you must know what you must do. But the particularity of it is always left out to the whimsy of the moment, if you understand.
