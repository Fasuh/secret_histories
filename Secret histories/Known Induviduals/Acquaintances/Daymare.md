St michael coffin????

comission seals for a coffin?

[[Saint Mikhail's Coffin]] - wouldn't want him to get. [[Mother of Ants]] would not prefer that. Need to look up some Seals for that. He is a rather unfortuitous person. Specifically, a rambunctious [[Alukite]], committed the crime of the [[Sky]] after he entered his long journey into the [[Histories|History]] itself. [[Mother of Ants]] would not want him out, before he commits such a crime again.

Can teach language:
- [[Ramsund]]
- [[Latin]]
- [[Greek]]

Chilu notes:
- She seems to serve [[Mother of Ants]]
- [[Mother of Ants]] is mentioned multiple times, i.e. [[Dr Arun Peel]] mentiones how she helped [[Colonel]] take down [[Seven Coils]]
