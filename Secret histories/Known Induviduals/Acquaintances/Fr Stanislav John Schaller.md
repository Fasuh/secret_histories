# Conversation

>Priest, diplomat, gardener: a soft-voiced man with a very steady gaze. 

>The Green Sages have long been interested in these doctrines, and the Haustorium has long been disinclined to share. The Sages are concerned that this might be a Haustorium trap. I suspect they're being overly cautious; but I have learnt, over the years, to take their instincts seriously.

>You know I had to manage Galmier's reincorporation, up in the mountains by the Grove? I wish I'd known these techniques back then. It was the most difficult thing I've ever done. And I think she'll most likely return to the Mansus anyway. (Although, at least, I can tease her that she smells of humus.)

>I am a gardener before I am a priest, and a priest before I am a healer. I know my limits. 'Everyone chooses their pathâ€¦ but I fear that my friend may have chosen to be a pathâ€¦ well, if so, I will not walk him. But I know enough now to understand what he might want. Thank you.
# Questions

## Id like to know who the hours are who own the heart principle
>It is [[The Velvet]], [[Ring-Yew|The Malachite]], [[The Sister-and-Witch]], [[The Thunderskin]], and [[The Witch-and-Sister]], [[The Lionheart]].
## Is the ring yew the malachite?
>Yes the ring yew is considered by many as [[Ring-Yew|The Malachite]]
## Do you know of any hours that associate with grail?
>A few, [[The Beachcomer]], [[The Flowermaker]], [[Ring-Yew|The Malachite]], [[The Red Grail]], and [[The Sister-and-Witch]] and [[The Witch-and-Sister]], and [[The Wolf-Divided]].
## Of the [[Hours]] that associate with [[Heart]] and [[Grail]] which one is your favourite?
>[[The Sister-and-Witch]], the one is serve. the [[Heart]] within that one is beyond amazing, and of course, there is nothing little to be said by breaking out of someones clasps, by becoming so strong in your principles
## Do you know of a way to contact [[The Sister-and-Witch]]
>traversing to lakesides, seasides, places close to the water, for we all know at least that follow them, that they are [[The Sister-and-Witch|The Sea Twins]].
## I've met [[The Sister-and-Witch]], what is required in [[Rite of the Sea's Feasting]]?
>You need a proper invocation, and appropriate tool, to invoke the good sisters, something that you can gift to them, hopefully to the sea itself, as we all know they came from there.
## I wish to know what is an item that [[The Sister-and-Witch]] would appreciate
>Something close to the heart, and that i mean the principle, not the actual beating one
>>So any tool of heart is sufficient?
>ofc the efficienty of it is improved if you put higher power in it, but nay heart should do.
## You mentioned that i have to give something to the sea, does it have to be tool or ingredient?
>No you are using the tool to discard to the sea, but don't discard the tool, what you give to the sea is someting sea can accept, usually oil, bomb, caul.
## With that in mind, with the [[Rite of the Sea's Feasting]], she gave me [[Geminate Invocation]], what does it do?
>Well, it is used in a manner of connecting with the twins, what it will do for you, its unknown to me. But if your chosen twin has given it to you, she expects something, my suggestion is do not disappoint.
>>As she is expecting something out of ritual that i need to give later?
>The Lore Fragment is a test in itself.
