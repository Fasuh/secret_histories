Priest, diplomat, gardener: a soft-voiced man with a very steady gaze. 

The Green Sages have long been interested in these doctrines, and the Haustorium has long been disinclined to share. The Sages are concerned that this might be a Haustorium trap. I suspect they're being overly cautious; but I have learnt, over the years, to take their instincts seriously.

You know I had to manage Galmier's reincorporation, up in the mountains by the Grove? I wish I'd known these techniques back then. It was the most difficult thing I've ever done. And I think she'll most likely return to the Mansus anyway. (Although, at least, I can tease her that she smells of humus.)
