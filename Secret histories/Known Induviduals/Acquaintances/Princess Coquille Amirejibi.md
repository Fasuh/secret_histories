# Conversation

>Artist, socialite... burglar? An unspeakably charming woman with a particular knack for getting adopted.

>My family-of-the-moment are total sweethearts, of course they are, but I am just the tiniest bit restless… and, well, if anyone in Venice might find themselves suddenly down a daughter, I'd like to have done my research.

>'They gave me a tour of the vaults at Oriflamme's once, you know. I don't really believe anyone could have got in. Not without rather more excitement, not without rather more of a mess.' 'But if it might turn out that it were true, well, a girl might find herself curious about exactly how the thing might have been carried off…'

## Can you tell me who are the hours of calyptra?
>I only know one of them, and that should be the velvet. hte others are quite curious but i do know for a fact that the white flower is indeed connected to winter
## What do you think of velvet?
>What is there to think about more of a pest than anything but a funny one, she hides things like a good easter egg hunt maybe there is a reason why grail and velvet are more akin than you believe
## Can you list me the hours of nectar
>its not my forte sadly, but i can name a couple of them, ofc one of them is velvet, the other one the red grail herself.
## Do you know where can i find a [[Vagabond's map]]
>best thing would be to ask one of the pesky rose long that hamper around, but i wouldnt concern myself with such things, unless you are keen on delving into the old dusty places of power i wouldnt care much about finding them, maybe a nice book could have a map for you. otherwise explore the world is wide and far reaching.
