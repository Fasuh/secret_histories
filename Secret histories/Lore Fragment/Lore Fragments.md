# Transformation Theory (Not proven)
The principles might be transforming in a set order, a selected principle will always transform to a set principle.
i.e. 
[[Heart]] will always turn into [[Grail]]
[[Knock]] can never be changed because its the end of the line

[[Edge]] > [[Winter]] > [[Heart]] > [[Grail]] > [[Moth]] > ...  > [[Lantern]] > [[Forge]] > ...> [[Moon]] > [[Rose]] > ... > [[Knock]]

# You cannot change from [[Knock]]
