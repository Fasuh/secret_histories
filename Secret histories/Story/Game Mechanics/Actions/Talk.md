It doesnt seem like you can affect the result using a lot of a Principle, some of the results are the same as the highest used, but the best we got is an additional memory. half of the results have the same Principle as the highest used principle, which could mean something, but imo its inconclusive.

If you use a lot of single Principle it seems like you can unlock [[Vault]], this Vault seems to be connected to the principle you used.

Using more of single principle seems to not only not reduce [[Notoriety]], but also increase the amount you gained but also increase the quality of a result.

It seems that we are getting memories instead of getting new acquaintances now, gaining memory seems to not raise [[Notoriety]], possibly we arent using enough principles.

## [[Notoriety]]

Can be removed here, look [[Notoriety]] for more info.

## Languages:

It seems that to learn a language you need to have sufficient Principle value, and talk to acquaintance. It also seems like acquaintances have one Principle which works as their main, and its easier to learn languages if your highest used Principle is the same as their main Principle.
