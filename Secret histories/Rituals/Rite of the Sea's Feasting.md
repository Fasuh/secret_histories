This Rite calls on the sister and witch to close the gap of what is and what might be the adept hurls an offering into water, preferably but not essentially the sea
## All of consumable ingredients are consumed


# [[Fr Stanislav John Schaller]] 
## I've met [[The Sister-and-Witch]], what is required in [[Rite of the Sea's Feasting]]?
>You need a proper invocation, and appropriate tool, to invoke the good sisters, something that you can gift to them, hopefully to the sea itself, as we all know they came from there.
## I wish to know what is an item that [[The Sister-and-Witch]] would appreciate
>Something close to the heart, and that i mean the principle, not the actual beating one
>>So any tool of heart is sufficient?
>ofc the efficienty of it is improved if you put higher power in it, but nay heart should do.
## You mentioned that i have to give something to the sea, does it have to be tool or ingredient?
>No you are using the tool to discard to the sea, but don't discard the tool, what you give to the sea is someting sea can accept, usually oil, bomb, caul.
