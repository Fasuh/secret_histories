Every sense is heightened; every sensation, deepened.

The [[Well in the Wood|Well]] in the [[Wood]] is never dry, but it is never clear. One night it might heave with crawling roots; on another, it will pulse with bright moss. On nights of the full moon its waters are choked with the fat dappled bodies of moths. Last night, I saw it brimming with dark and viscous blood. Gelatinous shreds drifted on its surface; clots of [[Grail]]-matter.

Chilu notes:
- [[Moth]] and [[Grail]] mentioned
	- possibly reference to [[Hour of Grail and Moth]] or [[Hour of Moth and Grail]]
