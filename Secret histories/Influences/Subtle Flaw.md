Laces uncoil -- windows swing open -- locks move as if oiled.

Last night I came in the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Wood]] to the high jagged rock called the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Temple of the Wheel]]. Its flank, patched with black lichen and eye-signs, opened like a mouth beneath my hands, and I walked in the whispering space within. The [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Gods-who-were-stone/Gods-who-were-stone]], the first of the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Hours]], are almost all gone now, but here their voices remain: [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Gods-who-were-stone/Wheel]], [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Gods-who-were-stone/Flint]], [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Gods-who-were-stone/Tide]], the others without names.

Chilu notes:
-  [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Gods-who-were-stone/Wheel]], [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Gods-who-were-stone/Flint]] and [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Gods-who-were-stone/Tide]] mentioned as [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Gods-who-were-stone/Gods-who-were-stone]]
	- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Gods-who-were-stone/Gods-who-were-stone]] could've become [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/gods-who-are]] as mentioned in [[Tridesma Hiera]]
