Laces uncoil -- windows swing open -- locks move as if oiled.

Last night I came in the [[Wood]] to the high jagged rock called the [[Temple of the Wheel]]. Its flank, patched with black lichen and eye-signs, opened like a mouth beneath my hands, and I walked in the whispering space within. The [[Gods-who-were-stone]], the first of the [[Hours]], are almost all gone now, but here their voices remain: [[Wheel]], [[Flint]], [[Tide]], the others without names.

Chilu notes:
-  [[Wheel]], [[Flint]] and [[Tide]] mentioned as [[Gods-who-were-stone]]
	- [[Gods-who-were-stone]] could've become [[gods-who-are]] as mentioned in [[Tridesma Hiera]]
