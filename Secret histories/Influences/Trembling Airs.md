The toes tap. All is brisk and all is well.

In the [[Wood]] beyond the walls of the [[Mansus]], a jagged rock rears like the petrified remnants of a dancing giant. I trailed my hand along its flank, over the eye-signs and lichen and the crude graffiti of the lesser [[Wood]]-powers, and I felt the thrumming of the [[Wheel]] which has passed. It has passed, but something continues.

Chilu notes:
-  The [[Wheel]] has passed but potentially if [[Tridesma Hiera]] was interpreted non literally, maybe it transformed into [[Moth]]
