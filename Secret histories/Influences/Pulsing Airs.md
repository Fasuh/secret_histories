A rising power; a reassuring energy.

The [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Hours]] have been called unmerciful, but they permit sleepers, sometimes, to walk in the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Orchard of Lights]], where each fruit glows like a sunset, where the roots of the trees are shaped for peaceful rest, where the mist soothes the heart. I was there last night, and the taste of the fruit lingers, sharp and sweet as the passage of spring to summer.
