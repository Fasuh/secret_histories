Emotions contort our thoughts. One passion yields to the next like leaves in the wind's grip!

Last night I came to the [[Concursum]], the [[Mansus]]-heart, which has been called the Chamber of Choices, where every path one does not take is a stillborn future. In the sea-sky blue of the Chamber's Light I saw the [[Sister-and-Witch]] pass, their four hands weaving two paths to one. I woke with my passions contorted to a knot. There's something I must do; there's always something I must do.
