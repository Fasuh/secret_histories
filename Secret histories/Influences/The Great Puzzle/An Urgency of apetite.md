It is difficult to control oneself.

The Ascent of Knives is called the Sharp Stair, and the Mother of Mirrors, and the Feast of the Grail. If one is to look beneath the stair, as I did last night in my dreams, one understands that last name. It draws a tithe of blood from the feet of those who ascend. Empousai - some shaped like men, many shaped like women - wait beneath the glass of the stairs to satisfy their hunger. I did not approach; I made no sound; I only observed.
