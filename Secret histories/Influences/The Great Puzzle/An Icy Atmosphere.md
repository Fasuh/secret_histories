#Winter #Moon #Influence 

The air crisps the skin. Frost marks the glass.

Last night the [[White Door]] was bright as a mirror, bright as fresh snow, bright as the migraine [[Moon]]. I remember its brightness, but I remember its chill the most. I laid my cheek against it. I still feel the ache of its cold in my skull.

Chilu notes:
- [[White Door]] seems to be dreamed by artisans as mentioned in [[The Locksmith's Dream portions and Proportions]], maybe a key to [[White Door]] is [[Forge]], the opposite of [[Winter]]
