#Door 

The Wood is the lowermost portion of the Mansus, lying outside the House Without Walls seemingly above the reaches of Nowhere. Once, the Wood was once a vibrant land of vividcolors, seemingly ruled by the old god-from-stone known as the Wheel. Since the Lithomachy, the Wood has become dark, and as passion and reason contend in the human soul, so too does the light of the Glory with the shadows of the Wood.

A realm of instinct and passion, the Wood is one of the parts of the Mansus most accessible to mortals, who may visit it in their dreams unaware of its true nature and learning to navigate its twisting paths more easily with limited knowledge of the occult. The Wood is also where all Dead initially go, who either become lost and drift down to Nowhere or proceed towards the White Door and into the House. This latter is the way the living follow too.

A number of Hours dwell here rather than in the upper echelons of the House. The Moth, Velvet, and Ring-Yew are all Wood-Hours, and there may be others such as the Witch-and-Sister and the Thunderskin who call the Wood home as well

The Well in the Wood: A murky well that heaves with various contents, from crawling roots and moss to dappled moths and even dark blood. It is sacred to both the Velvet and the Red Grail herself, suggesting that she may have once dwelt in the Wood as another Hour.

The Temple of the Wheel: A high, jagged rock covered in eye-signs, black lichen, and graffiti from spirits of the Wood. An ancient site, it now serves as a memorial to the Wheel and the other dead gods-who-were-stone, and echoes of their power may still be sensed here on occasion. Those who take their lives in the Wake may first throw themselves from its peak while dreaming.

The Door in the Wood: A passage hidden beneath the Well, which the neither the living nor the dead may pass. The Ligeian Medusa holds the Forest Key, which opens both it and the Stag Door. Where the Door leads is unclear, though it is used under the Aspect of the Moth to the path of Change and reminiscent shadow of the Carapace Cross

Visiting Well:
The Velvet is strong at the Well in the Wood, and the Velvet is the Hour that keeps secrets; but now and then she lets a little secret fall, like a crumb at a feast. Last night I found a moss-clad rock written all around with the secrets of another history. I might give thanks to the Velvet, but it will be wiser not to draw her attention.

I got knocked out, somehow i know the person i met was [[Kitling Ripe]]

after 20 heart - within the woods-coming from the well within it you meet a curious fellow, he seems less than a human and less than a form as well its like water a haze maybe even a mirage in some sense, within the depths of your lungs you feel like you are drowning, in that moment when your breath is short, you feel the song of a name thumping, deep in the depths of your mind, you know that this, is [[The Indigo Blade]], the name of [[The Sister-and-Witch]]
