#Door 

Mentioned in:
- [[An Icy Atmosphere]]
- [[The Locksmith's Dream portions and Proportions]]

In my dreams, I've passed the white door, which has been called the Bone Door and the Gate of Ivory. My voice remains outside the House each time I enter.

Now I can approach the White Door through the Bounds. Now I can press my fingers to it, feel its chill, watch it swing open. As it opens, my mouth closes, tightens, heals over like a lost deformity. Around and about me is the cobalt light of the [[Mansus]]â€¦

You meet a person named Theresa, you have no chance to follow her through the door
she says "the world is flat, so flat, i wont stay long i shant stay long, tell me secrets after the door."
