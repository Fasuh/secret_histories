In my dreams, I've passed the white door, which has been called the Bone Door and the Gate of Ivory. My voice remains outside the House each time I enter.

Now I can approach the White Door through the Bounds. Now I can press my fingers to it, feel its chill, watch it swing open. As it opens, my mouth closes, tightens, heals over like a lost deformity. Around and about me is the cobalt light of the [[Mansus]]â€¦

You meet a person named Theresa, you have no chance to follow her through the door
she says "the world is flat, so flat, i wont stay long i shant stay long, tell me secrets after the door."

As soon as you go trhru the white door you cannot speak, you cannot even breath anymore through your moouth, you try to take a breath its taken completely away, as it reaches your mouth its utterly gone, tehre is nothing there left.

In the distance you see an orchard of lights which the sun in splendor once wont its shadow still .. (i didnt hear) .. somethimes meniscate can be seen here or the medrugod, or rarely very rarely, but still the sun in splendour itself.

the fear delight at night, for there is the fourth child of the sun in splendour that may wander this place,

Beyond the white date you meet the rather rugged looking man, who is clearly beyond, there are a few longs you met, that are strange, weird, down right outlandish, but this one is stranger yet, because it does not seem to have a physical form, it is not unlike a mirage, a reflection, you could almost take it as, a trick of the light, almost, but he is still there, this curious personae stares at you for a bit, and presents you in form of language, secrets, secrets that allow you to hear, his curiosity, why you are serching with such abundance of moon, in the orchard of lights, a place that reveals truths someone like you is a bit off, trying to keep them at bay. before the conversation can really go on in this strange manner, and he clearly is capable of speak much profoundly and much more loudly thatn you can, eventually he dissipates away, but before he want away you knwo that was someone called Lars Westergren, identifying himself as a lantern long identifying himself as a lantern long.
