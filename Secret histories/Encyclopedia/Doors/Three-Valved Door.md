> But we must use the knife,' said the [[Lion-Throned One]], 'the noose, the flame, the Waking Word, against those who have passed the [[Three-Valved Door]]. And so none may pass: that is our Law, and the [[Law of the Sun]].

 - [[The Orchid Transfigurations Noon]]

Chilu notes:
- [[Law of the Sun]] disallows people to pass through [[Three-Valved Door]]
- passing [[Three-Valved Door]] seems to be a threat to [[Lion-Throned One]]
