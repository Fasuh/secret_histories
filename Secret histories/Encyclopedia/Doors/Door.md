#Door 

Known doors:
- [[Peacock Door]] 
	- [[Vak]]
	- [[Dr Yvette Southey]]
- [[White Door]]
	- [[An Icy Atmosphere]]
	- [[The Locksmith's Dream portions and Proportions]]
- [[Three-Valved Door]]
	- [[The Orchid Transfigurations Noon]]

Doors and Keys we have achieved so far:

## Doors:

- [[Way The Wood]] - [[Dreaming]] with a lot of [[Knock]] and [[Vak]] 
	- [[Vak]] possibly was completely useless here, and we found it with just [[Knock]]
- [[White Door|Way The White Door]] - [[Dreaming]] with a lot of [[Forge]]
	- this was mentioned in [[The Locksmith's Dream portions and Proportions]]

## Keys

- [[Wood Key]] - a lot of [[Moth]] + [[Nameday Riddle]] + [[Solutions & Separations]]
	- Possibly [[Nameday Riddle]] and [[Solutions & Separations]] didnt matter much more than the [[Moth]] they contributed
	- probably only a lot of [[Moth]] has contributed to this
