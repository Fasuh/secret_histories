>Calyptra is the law that requires secret knowledge to be forgotten - except in the libraries of the Watchman's Tree. The number of the Hours of the Calyptra is three, and we do not trust the third Hour, though we heed her. This paradox is a matter of Illumination.

>Calyptra is the law that requires secret knowledge to be concealed - except in the libraries of the Watchman's Tree. The number of the Hours of the Calyptra is three, and we do not speak of the oldest Hour. This observance is a matter of Bosk.
- [[Applebright Euphonies]]

>The Velvet is not the oldest Hour; but she is the oldest Hour of Calyptra. The Black Flower on the Watchman's Tree is the preservation of secrets, and without it the Tree would fall. This is a matter of Preservation.
- [[Edicts Inviolable]]

>The Mare-in-the-Tree is not the youngest Hour; but she is the youngest Hour of Calyptra, for she has been born many times in many places. The Red Flower on the Watchman's Tree is the fire fuelled by truth, and without it the Tree would fall, as all horomachists know.

>Certain knowledge is forbidden to mortalsâ€¦ unless it's wisely contained. This law is named [[Calyptra]]; the enforcement of this law is named [[Calyptra]] also; the three [[Hours]] who enforce it share that name. They permit that knowledge to persist only in certain sanctioned places, and the most dangerous secrets must only be recorded in the inks called encaustum terminale. [[Horomachistry]] teaches us [[Calyptra]]'s importance.

>Vak is a Great Scar; the first enemy of Calyptra. When the black flower blossoms on the Watchman's tree, she retreats, and Calyptra protects perilous knowledge behind secrecy's veil. The nature of their enmity is a Horomachistry matter.
- [[The Great Signs and the Great Scars]]

>Vak is a Great Scar; Calyptra's first mistake. If she could only be healed of her pain, Calyptra might reign inviolate, and the perilous knowledge it protects might be truly safe. The nature of her healing is a Hushery matter.
- [[The Great Signs and the Great Scars]]

>Something not commonly understood: were there no [[Calyptra]] to conceal perilous knowledge, there could be no [[Vak]]. A door opens both ways. This is understood by scholars of the Arts Unregarded. [[Birdsong]]
- [[Vak]]

>Something not commonly understood: without Vak, the exception, there could be no Calyptra, the law. Vak is in this sense, and perhaps in every sense, Calyptra's servant. This is known to scholars of the Night Arts. [[Nyctodromy]]

>Lacombe insists the items have been put to good use; he derides Nocturnal Branch as 'the lackeys of Calyptra'. Alarmingly, during the last few minutes of the interrogation, he begins to insist that his interrogator should 'burn the Library'. He waxes enthusiastic about the fire he wants to see, leading to a final coughing fit after which the interview abruptly ends.
- [[Valletri Interviews]]

Calyptra is a law against forbidden knowledge and a group enforcing it. 

Chilu notes:
- Could be somehow related to [[Watchman Tree]]
- The group which enforces [[Calyptra]] is also called [[Calyptra]]
