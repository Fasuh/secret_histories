It is said that there is seven [[Ligeians]], they hold the keys of dream. They serve [[Hour of Grail and Moth]] or [[Hour of Moth and Grail]].

Known [[Ligeians]]:
- [[Echidna (Unrevealed)]]

- [[KlÃªidouchos (Unrevealed)]]
- [[What-Is-Not-Seen (Medusa)|Medusa]]

[[The Viennese Conundra]] is heavily suggesting that there have appeared new [[Ligeians]], but it is said that [[Ligeians]] are as old as [[gods-from-stone]].

Chilu notes:
- Keys of dream possibly are referring to keys used to open [[Door|Doors]] to [[Mansus]]
- Currently we are unsure if [[Hour of Grail and Moth]] and [[Hour of Moth and Grail]] are the same person
- It is uncertain whether "Individual K." is a [[Ligeians|Ligeian]]
