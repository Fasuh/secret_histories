Exile riddle monger [[The Thunderskin]] devotee a confidant impecably dressed in dark clothing, dark the dressing too at his ankles and wrists, he wont take a seat, would be unkind of him to accept

Dr Arun Peel: can teach languages [[Vak]] and [[Fucine]]; he was once of a high and dedicated lineage, but left behind his life to serve the [[The Thunderskin]]

The [[The Thunderskin]] is an [[Hours|Hour]] which "beats to protect the skin of the world". He was originally a musician who loved the [[The Red Grail]] and ascended under her as a [[Names|Name]]. He later came to love the [[Ring-Yew, Malachite]], and was flayed by the [[The Red Grail]] as part of a treaty to placate [[The Horned-Axe]], as well as to help the [[The Red Grail|Grail]] challenge the power of the [[The Twins]] over the aspect of [[Heart]].

Can teach:
- [[Vak]]
- [[Fucine]]
- [[Coptic]]
