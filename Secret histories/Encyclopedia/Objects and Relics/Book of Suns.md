There seem to be two versions of this book:
- Received version
- Sanctioned version

Received version is the "pure" version of the book.
Sanctioned version seems to be a version that's made to align with the [[Church of the Unconquered Sun|Church]]

The book seems to talk about the [[gods-from-Light]] and more specifically [[Sun-in-Splendour]].
