There are 5 [[Histories]], barely anyone can interact with them

[[Alexander the Great]] knew how to travel between them

‘[[Eternity]] cannot be escaped; but in [[Histories|History]], it may be delayed,’

The [[Chancel of the Hours]] decides what can and cannot be done in [[Histories]].

"The inks in which the [[Histories]] are preserved."
- [[Inks of Containment]]

Chilu notes:
- It seems like [[Histories]] are alternative worlds which are reigned by [[Hours]]
- [[Histories]] could be located in dreams as mentioned in [[Edicts Liminal]]
