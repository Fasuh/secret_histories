'Travelling the night is neither faster or safer, that is why we do it.' Knowledge of the ways and byways of the transmundane.

The [[Mansus]] is the invisible realm of the Secret [[Histories]] Universe, where the [[Hours]] reign and influence our own reality, the Wake. It is divided into several different sections with various landmarks and locals.
While the [[Mansus]] has no walls, there are various [[Door]]s which must be passed to access each region of the dream realm, some of which have more specialized purposes as well... It should be noted that the term "[[Mansus]]" is used both in reference to the invisible realm as a whole and to a specific region, also known as the [[House of the Sun]], where a majority of the [[Hours]] reside.


[[The Bounds]] are the borderlands of the [[Mansus]], a sprawling maze of gray smoke and mist. They lie between the [[Wood]] and the House proper, though they may serve as a boundary encompassing the dream realm as a whole.

The [[Wood]] envelops the walls of the [[Mansus]], though the [[Mansus]] has no walls. It is a dark, primeval realm of passion and chaos, where the principle of the [[Moth]] is strongest.

The [[House of the Sun]] proper is the primary domain of the [[Hours]], where the majority of them reside and influence reality. 

The [[Secret Histories/Influences/Flowers/Glory|Glory]] is the apex of the [[House of the Sun]], an ultimate source of Light and enlightenment. It is the peak of the [[Lantern]] principle, and perhaps the aspects themselves.
It is also the origin point of the first [[gods-from-Light]], the [[Sun-in-Splendour]] and the [[Forge of Days]]. 

[[Nowhere]] is the dark and unknowable land that serves as the resting place of the dead, and the home of dangerous beings such as [[Worms|Worms]] and the [[gods from nowhere/gods-from-Nowhere]].

The [[House of the Moon]] is a strange reflection of the [[House of the Sun]], presided over by the [[The Meniscate]].


Has anyone ever entered the [[House of the Moon]]?: 
Yes. [[Long]] who have dedicated their lives to the [[Moon]] itself through [[Nyctodromy]]

Who are the [[gods from nowhere/gods-from-Nowhere]]? 
are mysterious [[Hours]] who originate from [[Nowhere]], they could be as old as [[gods-from-stone]]. More accepted thought is that they are the Gods who resided in [[Mansus]], in [[Nyctodromy]], before, who have been slain during the [[Lithomachy]], so they have become [[gods from nowhere/gods-from-Nowhere]]
[[gods from nowhere/The Crowned Growth]], the [[gods from nowhere/Mare-in-the-Tree]], the [[gods from nowhere/Applebright]], the [[gods from nowhere/Rising Spider]], the [[gods from nowhere/Witness]], and [[The Snow]].

Who is the [[The Meniscate]]?
[[The Meniscate]]

Chilu notes:
- [[The Meniscate]] seems to be heavily connected to [[Nyctodromy]]
