The most secret script of the innermost rites of the deep sects of the deep desert. The birth-tongue, it is claimed, of the [[The Mother of Ants]] herself.

There is a story known to jewellers: of a guild-master who made a wager with a keeper of butterflies. The master-jeweller claimed his jewelled egg would hatch something greater than any of the butterfly-keeper's chrysalids. Of course, after a month, the butterfly-keeper's gardens were bright with wings and the egg had hatched nothing at all. The jeweller, unable to pay his debts, fled into the desert with his egg. [[Horomachistry]] teaches us: know your limits.

There is a story known to candle-makers: of a guild-master who made a wager with a master of the potter's guild. The potter's oldest cup (she said) was older far than the chandler's oldest candle. However often one drinks from a cup, it can always be refilled. So they brought their witnesses to the judging on the appointed day, and the potter's witness brought a cup he had used for seventy years until its shattering. But the chandler's witness brought a candle seventy-seven years old: every month, the chandler had bought the old stumps, returned their matter to the vat, and used them in his wares, so that each newest candle was also the oldest. [[Ithastry]] teaches us: there's always a way.
