The Shepherd-Kings brought this speech west from Canaan to use in their wards and snares. Had they never come to Egypt, they might never found a way to write it; given its addictive qualities, that might have been for the best.

The veterans of the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Légion du Seuil]], who guard the boundaries of the waking world, tell stories of the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Labyrinths]] under the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/places 1/Mansus]], above the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Wood]], and inside the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Moon]], where the first fallen [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Hours]] sleep, or hide, or rot: the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Gods-who-were-stone/gods-from-stone]]. Why the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Labyrinths]]? Because, the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Légion du Seuil|legionnaires]] say, there are [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Hours]] ruling now who would fight to consume the last scraps of their old enemies; and those who feast would eclipse those who abstain. The [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Légion du Seuil|legionnaires]] have been known to boast that if they were only offered a great enough prize, they could guide the hungry Hours to their feast.

The assassins of the Tragulari, who end the long lives of Long, tell stories of the wars between the Hours in the dawn of the world, when the sun was red and low - wars where the savage sound of savage bells unravelled the light of moon and sun - wars where dreams burned on pyres where Long were the fuel. All this ended, the Tragulari say, once the Worms came, and the Hours had a common enemy. And so the Tragulari fear Worms; hate Worms; and make offerings to Worms. [[Skolekosophy]]
