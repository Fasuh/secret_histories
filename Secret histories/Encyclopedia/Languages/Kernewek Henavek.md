A forgotten language.

Kernewek Henavek; the oldest form of the language now called Cornish; or something even older.

A farmers' proverb in Brancrug: 'What starts in the roots, ends in the sky.' A superstition goes with it, that before a child's first birthday you should leave her for a summer night sleeping in the roots of an apple-tree, to make sure she grows tall and straight-backed. Not many pay heed to the superstition now, but everyone remembers the proverb. It would probably count as [[The Bosk|The Bosk]].
