A people lived east of the lost lake Fucino. Horace warned that theirs was the land of witches. This was their language, called by some 'the dry tongue' and by others 'the tongue of witches'.

There is a story known to painters: of a Queen who could love no other, neither woman nor man, but only her own image. She sought nine colours to grace the image, and the last was the turquoise of her eyes, a gift from the Shadowless King. Her court poet hymned his Queen and her image, and in his poem she heard the truth: that the image was greater. So she fled into the Wood, and the image ruled her domain with the poet as its consort, but it always remembered her kindly. [[Hushery]]

There is a story known to smiths: of a Queen whose realm was invaded by a great army. When she learnt that there were nine invaders for every defender, she ordered her army to surrender its swords. Night and day her smiths laboured to melt down the swords to bronze, while her generals threatened mutiny and the enemy advanced unhindered. They used the bronze to cast a Bell, but each time the Bell was rung, it cracked and had to be recast. At last on the night before the invaders reached the city, the Queen surrendered her crown to the casting. When at dawn the smiths rang the Bell, it cracked the moon like an egg and drove the sun from the sky. The invaders fled. But the Queen without a crown was no longer any queen at all.
