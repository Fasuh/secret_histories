This language has been called 'mantiq al-tair' and 'lenga aucel' and 'the speech of birds' and 'Ramsund' and 'the hazelnut tongue', but it's a language of secrets, and its true name may never be used. The aviform [[Hours]] use it at their Roost, or so the story goes.

There's a very old story told by thieves about a competition among the aviform [[Hours]] - the secret gods who take the shape of birds.

The dove boasted of the bones he'd stolen from flesh,

and the crow of the flesh he'd picked from bones.

One of the kite-twins bragged that that she'd stolen the borders from kingdoms,

and the other that she'd taken the roads from crossroads.

The magpie told all the colours he'd taken that are no longer found in the world,

and the laughingthrush topped that with the tales of the sights she'd stolen.

But when the glitter-winged seventh of their number told them what he'd stolen, they all were shocked into silence.

They fell upon him and stripped him of his wings and drove him from the sky. So he, and what he stole, are gone from the world, and now we cannot even name them, but still we feel their lack.
[[Preservation]]

There's a very old story told by falconers about the aviform Hours - the secret gods who take the shape of birds. Once there were only five - the dove, the crow, the laughingthrush, the twin kites. The sixth had fallen to the talons of an owl, and they sought another to join their company. But the crow rejected half of all those they found, for the dowdiness of their plumage, and the dove rejected the others, for being too gaudy. At last they found a night-bird whose feathers were both the perfect white and the perfect black of the crow and of the dove. But once they had accepted him they learnt he was no bird at all - only a night-flitting moth. Fortunately for the moth, their pride kept them from admitting their mistake; but since that day, the aviform Hours will only meet at night, when the sixth of their kind won't be unmasked.

- This could refer to [[gods from nowhere/gods-from-Nowhere]], there is only 6 of them known to us, there is a possibility one of them was banished.
- This could refer to the flaying of [[The Thunderskin]] as "glitter-winged" bird could be a representation of him
- [[Twins]] are mentioned to remove roads from crossroads, this is also mentioned in [[Sister-and-Witch]]
