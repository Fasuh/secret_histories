A primal Language

In the Tracks of Beasts, in the Convolutions of his own Carapace, in Egg-vein and Shell-shadow, the Many-Eyed One found the Signs which can be History.

Cracktrack is the native tongue of the living world. As long as [[Cracktrack]] is spoken, in cloud-shape and hill-form, life persists. This is a matter of [[Preservation]].

Cracktrack was a gift from the light above the world. When Glory touched the first life-motes with this language, they entered the waking world. They were Illuminated. [[Illumination]]
