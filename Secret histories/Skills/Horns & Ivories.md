"The Hunter, the Way, and their memories."

When the [[Moth]] goes a-hunting in the dark of the [[Wood]], he remembers a time when the [[Wood]] was bright, but he uses his horns to find the way, and we may follow him if we choose. After all, a trophy is nothing without a hunt: that's the lesson of the [[Wood]].

When the [[Chandler]] goes a-hunting in the dark of the [[Wood]], he shields his candle so his prey is not forewarned, but he leaves a trail of ivory wax so we may follow him and purchase his prizes. After all, the goal of every hunt is to bring home a trophy, and when we understand [[Skolekosophy]], we know how to bargain.

Principles:
1. [[Scale]]
2. [[Knock]]

Wisdoms:
- [[The Bosk]]
- [[Skolekosophy]]

Chilu notes:
- Possible reference to [[Moth]] having horns, further proving that [[The Horned-Axe]] could be [[Moth]]
	- This is also a teaching of [[The Bosk]] which seems to be connected to [[Sisterhood of the knot]] which serves [[The Horned-Axe]]
