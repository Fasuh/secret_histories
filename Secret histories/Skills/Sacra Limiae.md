The rites of an order of immortals who have tried to remain apart. These rites touch on secrets of Hours of the Mansus - chiefly gods-who-were-flesh and gods-from-Light.

The Hours are not all-powerful. There is a place beyond their reach, where mortals and immortals might build a shining City of iron and ivory. Horomachists understand the Hours' limits.

The Hours are not eternal. The Sun-in-Splendour was riven and cast down. If we mortals so desire, we might prevent his return. Understand Hushery, and you understand endings.
