#Winter #Moth #Birdsong #Skolekosophy #Skill 

To speak with the dead; to torment the living; to celebrate both.

The sights we name are rarely named by day
The shapes we seek are rarely sought in clay
The names we claim are often claimed as pay.
This is Skolekosophy.

The shapes that loped beside you in the frost,
The scraps you gleaned of caul and periost
Once these were answers to 'What May Be Lost?'.
All part of the matter we call Birdsong.
