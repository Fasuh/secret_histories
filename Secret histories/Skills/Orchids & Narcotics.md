There is no greed without beauty.

Learn from blood and drink from the earth. The Red Grail brought forth the Hours called Flowermaker and Beachcrow, who know where in the wood we can find delight. These are the temptations of Bosk.

If flowers are flame, the earth is their fuel. The Hour named Flowermaker cannot harm us, and he cannot find us, but he always has what we desire, and the Hour named Chandler can bring the spark to light the flame. These are the temptations of Skolekosophy.
