Knives, dangers, and things out of place.

Before speech, we could not dream, which is to say that before we could wield words, we were weaponless, and even Long dared not enter the Mansus for fear of being devoured. It's not obligatory for Long to wield the weapons of speech, but they generally choose to. Perhaps that's why the Hours charge their Names to hunt down Long - even the Long who claim to serve them.

Before speech, we could not dream, which is to say that before speech tore open the Peacock Gate to dreams, the Mansus was unwounded and at peace. It's not obligatory for Long to pass that gate, but they generally choose to. Perhaps that's why the Hours charge their Names to hunt down Long - even the Long who claim to serve them. Hushery recognises this truth.
