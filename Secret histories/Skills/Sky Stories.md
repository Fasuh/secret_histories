The nine winds gossip, and sometimes we can listen.

A thief of sights, a scavenger of thrones,
A border-reaver and a thief of knots
A thief of colours and a thief of bones.
This is Birdsong.

The Pilgrim's intrigue and the Grail's scheme
The Sun in shadow and the Forge unseen
The Swan King and the Elagabaline.
This is Horomachistry.
