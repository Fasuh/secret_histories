#Winter #Heart #Hushery #Preservation #Skill 

Arts which quench fires and bring solace to the troubled mind. 'A true adept is never troubled by fire, nor by fever, nor by restless spirit'.

Unwise words are dangerous. Mourn them, remember them, speak them not. This is Hushery.

Let the flesh forget disease, let the smoke forget the flame, let the troubled mind forget its pain: Preservation.
