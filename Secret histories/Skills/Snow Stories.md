Still all the winds, still every the beating tongue Now still the mirrored moon, the sea's cauldron When nothing's left then nothing is undone. [[Hushery]].

Chilu notes:
- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Medusa's Riddle]] mentioned here.
- [[Coil Queen]] is it the same as [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Seven Coils]]? is it their leader?
- Mirrored moon possibly means [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Sun-in-Splendour]]
	- Alternatively it could be a reference to [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/places 1/House of the Sun]] and [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/places 1/House of the Moon]]
	- This could mean that [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/places 1/House of the Sun]] is currently stagnant or frozen?
