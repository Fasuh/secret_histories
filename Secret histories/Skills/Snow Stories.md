#Winter #Moon #Birdsong #Hushery #Skill 

"Of wind, woe, and winter."

Still all the winds, still every the beating tongue Now still the mirrored moon, the sea's cauldron When nothing's left then nothing is undone. [[Hushery]].

[[Medusa's Riddle]], first: What Is Not Seen? The Night, the [[Heart]], the [[Moon]], the Day. Between. The palest key. The birth-scarred [[Coil Queen]]. This is [[Birdsong]].

Principles:
1. [[Winter]]
2. [[Moon]]

Wisdoms:
- [[Birdsong]]
- [[Hushery]]

Chilu notes:
- [[Medusa's Riddle]] mentioned here.
- [[Coil Queen]] is it the same as [[Seven Coils]]? is it their leader?
- Mirrored moon possibly means [[Sun-in-Splendour]]
	- Alternatively it could be a reference to [[House of the Sun]] and [[House of the Moon]]
	- This could mean that [[House of the Sun]] is currently stagnant or frozen?
