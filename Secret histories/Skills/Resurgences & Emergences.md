"Birth and death are only directions. Between the two we find a crossroads."

The [[gods-from-stone]] made a law that the keys of dream cannot be held or owned. The time of Stone is past, but the keys remain. So the holders of these keys can only be the seven [[Ligeians]], whose crime has set them outside the law. But the [[Ligeians]] serve an [[Hour of Grail and Moth]]: when the last remnants of the [[gods-from-stone]] are consumed, the law will be consumed with them. [[The Bosk]] is the wisdom of change.
