"The inks in which the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Histories/Histories]] are preserved."

Certain knowledge is forbidden to mortals… unless it's wisely contained. This law is named [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Calyptra]]; the enforcement of this law is named [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Calyptra]] also; the three [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Hours]] who enforce it share that name. They permit that knowledge to persist only in certain sanctioned places, and the most dangerous secrets must only be recorded in the inks called encaustum terminale. [[Horomachistry]] teaches us [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Calyptra]]'s importance.

Certain knowledge is forbidden to mortals… except in nine great libraries protected by the covenant-stones they hold, where this knowledge can be safely recorded in the inks called encaustum terminale. These libraries are together called the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Watchman tree/Watchman Tree|Watchman's Tree]], and the covenant marked by these stones shares that name. All this, then, is a matter of [[Preservation]].

Its the very nature of preserving history itself. Whatever you can make cannot die, or be forgotten at least
