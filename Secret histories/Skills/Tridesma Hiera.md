The rites of the [[Sisterhood of the knot|Sisterhood of the Triple Knot]], which include certain mysteries of the dwellers in the [[Wood]] behind the World. 

The [[Moth]] consumed the [[Wheel]]; the [[Grail]] consumed the [[Tide]]; in the days of the [[Forge]], the Stars fled from every facet of [[Flint]]. What feast was the first? Those who walk the [[Wood]] know that whichever was first, the [[Grail]]'s was greatest.

What lit the [[Wood]] in the days before its darkening? There was a light upon the earth long before Glory came to the sky. Preserve the night, and the light might return.
