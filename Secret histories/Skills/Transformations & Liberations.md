Forge and Moth are less different than we think. Every change is in some way a release.

If the Sun has failedâ€¦ then we must manufacture our own Second Dawn, with eye, with hand, with the light beneath the heart. It won't be easy, but what great work ever is? [[Ithastry]] might shape the way.

If even the Sun's division was a plan... then once we complete that plan, we'll bring the Second Dawn, and unite the sun. It won't be easy, but what great work ever is? [[Illumination]] might show the way
