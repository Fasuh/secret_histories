Conspiracy of roses. There are other appetites than love.

In the upper room of the house where I am taken, my breath fogs and my eyes grow soft. The light in the room is the light at the end of the sun. I am a beautiful ending. 

For a little while I dwell in the high rooms of the Mansus, and then I return through the Gate, and I tear free of the sticky rags of my old flesh. My new body is smooth without and red within like a sweet fruit. My limbs are strong as cables. My senses are knives. I will not grow old. I will walk the world in the service of the feast the growing. Perhaps I will rebel. Perhaps, one day, I will rise even higher. [[The Bosk]]
