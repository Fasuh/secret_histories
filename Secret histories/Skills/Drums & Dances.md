The first musics were not made by mortals, but taken; from sand-coil and sea-thorn, from flint-heart and dragon-womb.

The Thunderskin, the eternal drum that beats to preserve the skin of the world, is a god-from-flesh, which is to say he was once mortal. But the Horned-Axe, last of the gods-from-stone, required his death, and so the Grail gave him up, though he loved her. Love is always subject to the will of the Hours, as all horomachists know.

The Thunderskin, the eternal drum that beats to preserve the skin of the world, is a god-from-flesh, which is to say he was once mortal. He died to preserve the last god-from-stone; he died for love; he died for necessity. In matters of Bosk, these three are often intertwined.
