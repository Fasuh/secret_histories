All days are death, all lives are sunset. No fire will last without fuel; there can be no Second Dawn without a war to burn the bones of earth. This is Ithastry at its most merciless.

All days are death, all lives are sunset. For a time, light persists, but we should not fear the scorch of a Second Dawn.
