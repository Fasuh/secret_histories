'Nine modes, nine horizons': the subtle rhythms of words which open ways.

One of us passed the Summit. One may not. Two of us sought the Lantern. Two chose flight. The seventh rarely named, but not forgot. This is Illumination.

Birds of a scale, wings and talons bright Worms of a feather, kissed again by stones Kissed by fire, kissed by snow, by blight. This is Ithastry.
