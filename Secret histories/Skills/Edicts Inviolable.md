The Velvet is not the oldest Hour; but she is the oldest Hour of Calyptra. The Black Flower on the Watchman's Tree is the preservation of secrets, and without it the Tree would fall. This is a matter of Preservation.

The Mare-in-the-Tree is not the youngest Hour; but she is the youngest Hour of Calyptra, for she has been born many times in many places. The Red Flower on the Watchman's Tree is the fire fuelled by truth, and without it the Tree would fall, as all horomachists know.
