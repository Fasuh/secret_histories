"The precepts of limitation and division; established by the enigmatic conclave of [[Hours]] sometimes called the [[Chancel of the Hours|Chancel]]."

There is a prophecy of a glorious City that mortals could raise, but the [[Hours]] of the [[Chancel of the Hours|Chancel]] have decreed that it will not exist. The decrees of the [[Chancel of the Hours|Chancel]] are not defied, but now and then they have been circumvented… and we might conceive that a City with walls of shining [[Flint]] could be raised in dreams; in the [[Mansus]].
