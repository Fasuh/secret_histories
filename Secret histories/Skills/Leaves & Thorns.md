There is no scent without sorrow.

The gardener's first lesson is this: look up. What starts as weather ends in the world, what starts as sky ends in the soil. This is what the birds know, and the birds know most things first.

The gardener's first lesson is this: know your thorns, know your poisons. There's no point thinking about tomorrow when we aren't expecting to live through today. This is the lesson our ancestors learnt the hard way in the Wood: this is Bosk.
