Beasts, birds, husbandry, harvest.  

When the first hunters were lost in the [[Wood]], in the days before its darkening, they found a chrysalis of black and white. To it they sacrificed the birds of the air, so that it would show them the way home. So the [[Moth]] came to be, and so the [[Moth]] was the first to navigate the ways of the [[Wood]]. This is the foundation of [[Nyctodromy]].

When the first hunters were starving in the [[Wood]], in the days before its darkening, they found a deep and crimson well. In it they drowned the beasts of the earth, so that the beasts would be reborn threefold, and the hunters could feast. So the [[The Red Grail]] came to be, and so ever since she feeds us and she feeds upon us. This, the [[Sisterhood of the knot|Matriarchs of the Knot]] have taught us.

> Bryan describes how a 'Sky-inspired fife' can be prepared using these [[Furs & Feathers|Fur and Feathers]] techniques, in the presence of greater [[Sky]]-aspect, to 'make of the winds good neighbours.' It's a powerful technique to be described so casually: Brian's main interest seems to be in ensuring good weather for his hunts.

Chilu notes:
- Possibly references the birth of [[Moth]] and [[The Red Grail]]
