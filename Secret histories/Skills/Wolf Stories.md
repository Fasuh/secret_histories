Sometimes we eat the wolf, and sometimes the wolf eats us.

The Sanctioned Version of the [[Book of Suns]] says that the Wolf-Divided was awoken by the Sun's division. We know from this that the [[The Wolf Divided]] was its own [[Hours|Hour]] even when the Sun was whole. So we glean and we guess that the Sun might be healed, and the [[The Wolf Divided]] return to its slumbers. So we glean and guess that a Second Dawn would bring peace, but the [[The Wolf Divided]] will fight to prevent it. This is [[Birdsong]].

The Received Version of the [[Book of Suns]] tells us that the Wolf-Divided was born from the [[Sun-in-Splendour]]'s division. We know from this that the Sun can be reborn only if the [[The Wolf Divided]] joins the Sun's other selves. Only if the [[The Wolf Divided]]'s hunger is assuaged will it join its other selves. And only the flesh of its other selves can assuage the hunger of the [[The Wolf Divided]]. A Second Dawn would herald the Last Day. This is the grim lesson of [[Skolekosophy]].

Chilu notes:
- This text suggests that the [[Church of the Unconquered Sun|Church]] does not consider [[The Wolf Divided]] an [[Hours|Hour]] by itself
- [[The Wolf Divided]] is related to the [[Sun-in-Splendour]] in some way
	- It is suggested that its either born of [[Sun-in-Splendour]] division or an [[Hours|Hour]] that is awoken by its division
