The greater plagues may not be cured, only bound. The very greatest of all may only be entreatedâ€¦ and it is death to do so improperly.

The [[gods-who-are]], which we call the [[Hours]], warred against the [[gods-from-stone]] and cast them down. What remains of the [[gods-from-stone]] we call plague, scourge, catastrophe. If the [[Hours]] were cast down in their turn, would the [[gods-from-stone]] be satisfied? Would revenge bring peace? The Night Arts hint that it might be so.
