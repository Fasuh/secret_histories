'To know what will pass in what has passed.' The practitioners of this discipline see endings and beginnings, passages and transitions, in the same mode as dawn and sunset.

Each journey is a day, and we are tested as travellers and as pilgrims. That is the part these Contemplations play in the Nyctodromy Wisdom.

Yesterday's light determines the colours of tomorrow... and through Illumination, we learn that we all began in light.
