The ways of the hill-children and the gods-from-stone. Old paths, old secrets, the songs that still echo beneath the earth.

In the beginning, the Carapace Cross served the first Hours, the gods born from stone. And the first of the Carapace Cross were the Thritige-kind, who sought the Monarch-at-the-Crossroads to rule them wisely and found him in themselves, who began as many and ended as one. This is a riddle, and the riddlemakers know its importance.

In the beginning, the Carapace Cross served the first Hours, the gods born from stone. When the gods-from-stone were defeated, where could the Cross go? Into the hills; into the Bounds; and into us. This is how humankind came to be, and in our most secret hollows, the Cross endures. This is a matter of Preservation.
