The depths of the sea, the waves upon the shore, and the memories of their withdrawal.

The Sea accepts every gift it is given, and sometimes, now and then, those gifts are returned. The Red Grail slew the Hour named Tide, and what remained was given to the Sea; so, perhaps, one day, that Hour might return. This is life, and so this is Bosk.

The Sea: whale-road, salt-realm, moon-way. Anything given to the waves may find another home - unless its home is the Sea. Nyctodromy shows us the way across the sea, and the way home.
