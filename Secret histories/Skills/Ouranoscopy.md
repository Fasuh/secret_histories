Ourano - Uranus
Scopy - Viewing

Consider the Star. Hath each Star, is Seven Names. Observe that these Names are Never Shared.

If the stars are wisdom, then dawn is ignorance. A day might come when there is no dawn. Ouranoscopy should be numbered among the Night Arts.

If night is peace, then dawn is battle, when the Sun drives the stars from the sky. A day might come when the Sun's victory is not assured. The battles of heaven are a matter of Horomachistry.
