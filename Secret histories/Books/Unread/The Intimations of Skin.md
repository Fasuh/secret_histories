Fiendishly complex, weirdly distorted illustrations of 'congress and anatomy' by the haunted visionary painter Niels Frederik Malskær.

Malskær illuminates the evolutions of the Names of the Grail with unfortunate clarity. It seems that a Lovely who consumes an Ivory becomes an Ivory. A Lovely who consumes a Thirstly becomes a Thirstly. A Lovely who consumes a Name of another Hour might take its place...

In the penultimate illustration, a Lovely grapples with a fungoid knot that can only be a Name of the Crowned Growth. The Lovely's mouth and other portals gape wide, and the Growth-Name is already partially engulfed - but it seems that Malskær couldn't bring himself to illustrate the result, and the final illustration is only a scrawled, bloated obscurity.
