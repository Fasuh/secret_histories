A scathing obloquy about the Corrivality and their participants whom wish to ascend under the aspect of conquest and conflict. Believed to be written by the Coil-queen herself.

The writer represents the dyad of the Strife Imperishable as an utterly useless man-made exercise. Insulting the Chiliarch for his short-sightedness to achieve the state Corrivality before his slaying of the Seven-Coils and his inability to see the Milk-Thief as anything more than a cobelligerent.

The writer further expresses distaste for the Golden General, although with less spite than those previously mentioned as he was capable to establish the Corrivality and lend its rite to the upright apes. However the writer deplores this rite, for the true nature of Strife Imperishable existed long before words, even before the apes. It was there between the bending trees and the howling wind, the firm rocks, in the cutting rivers. A rite not created, but lost in the presence of gods-from-light. A rite truly understood only by the Divided One.
