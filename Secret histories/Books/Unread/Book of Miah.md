An account of the 'five visits of the Desert Wanderer' - probably the Hour called the Vagabond - to the city Miah. She begins as a delighted child - perhaps even a mortal - but things then go badly…

In her second visit, she came as Laughingthrush. Her heart was bright within, her beak was ripe with song, but in the first moment her feathers touched the city stones, the laughter began….'

The Wanderer's penultimate visit is as Centipede, whose 'venom cracks stone'. Miah is abandoned to the desert. But she returns one last time, again as Laughingthrush, with four other Hours who take the shape of birds, 'to celebrate the First Roost above the bones of her hated kin.'
