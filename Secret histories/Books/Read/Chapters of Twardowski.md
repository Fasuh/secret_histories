#Heart #Read #Book 

Comprehensive codex of various trades, deals, endeavours and cautionary tales written by the sorcerer Master Twardowski.

Twardowski talks about meeting many Long through his days as a sorcerer for King Sigismund. Possibly embellishing some of his stories as a mentor to some of them, teaching them rites and skills which he learned of the invisible arts.

The book ends more akin to a farewell, wishing that astute students of the invisible arts find his work helpful, and promises to help those who are capable of showing heavy heart-aspect to the Formulae Vigilant along with Edicts Inviolable.
