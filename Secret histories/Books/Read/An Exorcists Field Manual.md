A practical guide to 'troublesome Dead', grounded in theory but with a clear focus on their disposal, by the redoubtable [[Detective-Ostiary Wheelock]] of the [[Suppression Bureau]].  

The [[Dead]] usually avoid Light - as the most immediate manifestation of [[Eternity]], which has no place for death. 

However those [[Dead]] 'uplifted by gold', that is to say touched by an actinic theoplasma, happily bod about in daylight and are perhaps strongest at noon... 

If you are dead but 'uplifted by green', that's the [[Ring-Yew]]'s blessing.

([[gods from nowhere/The Crowned Growth]] offers a similar but nastier benefit.) This is how Burgeoning Risen come about, but there are different degrees of sentience and freedom depending on which growths are involved. The consciousness of one 'uplifted by green' is always greatly altered, though - they never really seem like the same person. They may have dregs of their original souls, but these are often replaced by something else. The upshot, invariably, is that they need to be set firmly on fire.

Chilu notes:
- Theoplasmic [[Dead]] are the strongest during the day, they are called 'uplifted by gold'
- [[Dead]] blessed by [[Ring-Yew]] are called 'uplifted by green', they are never like the same person.
