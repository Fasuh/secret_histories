Everett Vinzant transcribed these from a cliff in Anatolia, where he famously survived a lightning-strike. He died seven years later to the day. His bones, the legend has it, were hot to the touch.

Long ago, the [[Sisterhood of the knot]] recounted, the [[Forge]] loved the [[Hours|Hour]] called the [[Sun-in-Splendour]]. The [[Red Grail]] long anticipated their union, and the [[Grail]]-priestesses prophesied it...

The remainder of the text consists of gloating remarks by the [[Grail]]-priestesses of the Shaping that will come, interpolated with warnings and laments from those of the [[Sisterhood of the knot|Sisterhood]] who serve the [[Ring-Yew]] and especially the [[The Horned-Axe|Horned Axe]]. Nevertheless, an invocation to the [[Forge]] is included as part of an attempt to urge it onwards.

Chilu notes:
- [[Forge]] loved [[Sun-in-Splendour]]
- [[Red Grail]] anticipated their union
- We know that [[Sun-in-Splendour]] was divided by [[Forge of Days]]
- Is [[Forge]] the same as [[Forge of Days]] ?
- [[Sisterhood of the knot]] serves [[Ring-Yew]] and [[The Horned-Axe]]
