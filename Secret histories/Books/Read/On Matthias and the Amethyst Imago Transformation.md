An account of an occult romance. A certain Iyavogos claims to have written this in a single night as part of his initiation into the Aleppine branch of the House of Lethe - that order of immortals who would not pledge themselves to any Hour.

We cast Matthias out, and we pronounced a curse upon the Amethyst Imago, but we watched them in dreams. We saw them pledge themselves to the Forge, to change themselves and ascend anew. Into the fire they fly.

This is the first of the practices that the Imago and Matthias used, to begin their ascent to power. They have risen beyond our sight, but their flames may yet burn in the Malleary.'
