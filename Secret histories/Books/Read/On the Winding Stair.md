Gregory Wheelock, the master mason and architect employed by Walter Dewulf to construct the Winding Stair and the guest chambers in Hush House, describes a more ambitious and dangerous project.

Gregory marks the bricks of his Roost-touched family home, Treowen, with Ramsund bricks, hoping to open forbidden doorsâ€¦

Gregory evidently succeeds in opening a way to something he calls the 'Moon-Hall', but here his account becomes erratic. He insists that in the Moon-Hall the Horned-Axe is still an Edge-power; he hopes for an 'eternal rival', but cannot find the one he needs. The narrative is increasingly interspersed with chess notations, and ends abruptly.
