#Rose #Coptic #Read #Book 

An extensive collection of perfumes compiled by Meresamun Nubhotepti, a priestess of Shezmu. This book seems to be compiled throughout multiple dynasties, going from original ancient coptic to modern egyptian.

The book is rather poetic and many times meandering, mentioning feasts of wine and the slow streams of blood within the pages. Between the poems and the recipes, it tells a tale of nectar which was fought over by the Usurping-Mother and the Bright-of-Blood, whom the author vehemently mentions as the sister of the Lover-of-the-Yew.

Meresamun declares nectar as an old-new principle of the invisible arts. One which has been feasted upon, but cannot be consumed. She declares her proof with her final recipe where with sufficient amounts of nectar-aspect and a participant alongside Roses and Perfumes may create Sacrament Malachite.
