The epic of the final battle of the Lionsmith with the remnant-giant Antaios.

As always, the Lionsmith drew his strength from metal, and Antaios from stoneâ€¦ but the Lionsmith began to suspect also that this time, Antaios was drawing power from the Moon.

The Lionsmith beseeches the Three for their assistance, and the Meniscate favours him with a skin of silver, like water, like mercury, so he too can drink power from the Moon; for, she whispers, he too will one day be drawn into a perfect balance.
