A blandly positive work on the Endeavour Club, published by the Endeavour Club. The Club was founded in 1862 but claims to draw from much older traditions.

Club members are assigned names out of noble myth - 'Jaufre', 'Roland', and, unexpectedly, 'Breadbeddel'. They claim to be heirs to the Leashed Flame, which gave the island of Britain such appalling power in some histories.

Their 'Endeavour' itself is a purifying fire which makes its fuel something more than human. This transformation, however, is no longer encouraged by the Club, and perhaps - the work is coy on this - no longer permitted.
