A book of kitchen-garden techniques and aphrodisiac recipes recorded by Ernestine Peterhans, the 'Iron Seneschale' of Hush House for three generations of Dewulfs.    „

Peterhans asserts casually that the rousing liquor called 'Rubywise Ruin', which Leaves & Thorns techniques can brew from flowers, was a favourite of the notoriously severe Baron Thomas. If true, this would have raised eyebrows had it been known in his lifetime...    „

Peterhans mentions that one of these [[Leaves & Thorns]] techniques, with sufficient [[Nectar]] aspect, can supposedly cause 'a marvellous copper fruit' to burst from wood, although she has never managed it herself - but in a 'certain season' the pear-trees in the Practic Garden will deliver something similar.
