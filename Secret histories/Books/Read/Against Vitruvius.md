A fourteenth-century treatise on esoteric mechanics and parahydraulics by [[Abbot Ranulph]], best known now as a mason-architect.

[[Abbot Ranulph|Ranulph]] describes how he tested some of these techniques in the construction of the [[Long Tower|Winter Tower]] (now called the [[Long Tower]]). He admits to unexpected consequences…    „

[[Abbot Ranulph|Ranulph]] mentions that the tower of [[Ely Cathedral]] collapsed around the time the [[Long Tower|Winter Tower]] was completed… although he stops short of suggesting that one was the cause of another. 'A tower falls, a tower rises,' is all he'll commit to.
