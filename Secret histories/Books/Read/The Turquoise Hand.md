#Rose #Ramsund #Read #Book 

A calligraphic manual of Ramsund which employs as exemplar-text Farid ud-Din's 'Conference of the Birds'.

'At noon the Sun moves like the beating of a wing. At sunset he sends the herald-child with her candle. At midnight, he sends the wind that extinguishes the candle-flameâ€¦'

Commentary, illustrations and interleavings carry revelations never intended in the original: a sense of history, and the senses of Histories.
