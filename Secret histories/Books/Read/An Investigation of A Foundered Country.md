Subtitled 'Recordings from the Atlantic Coast.'

The phonograph initially seems to consist entirely of wave sounds, and the cries of gulls - but attention to the cries suggests they are not gulls at all - perhaps not even birds.

The bird-cries resolve to possibly-human voices, half-lost in the sound of waves. They lament the absence of a 'city unborn'; they hymn the 'ice behind the wave,' the 'amber cobbles', or perhaps 'amber corals.' The tenor of their song is melancholy but also, increasingly, menacing, as they promise the 'city irresistible.' As the voices fade, distant bells are clearly to be heard among the surf-sounds.

Chilu notes:
- Possibly speaks about [[Ys]]
