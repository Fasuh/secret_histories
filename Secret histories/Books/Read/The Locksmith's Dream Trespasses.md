The third volume of Teresa Galmier's examination of parallels in the mystic dreams of artisans.

In this volume, notoriously, Galmier's prose begins to disintegrate, and it is not clear which dreams are in fact her own.

The woman in the sand-coloured robe has told me: the stairways of the Mansus go ever up. Death is down. The Mother of Ants guards both directions with each of her heads, and so the passage must always be through a wound. I think the White Door might be a wound. That's one reason the Dead sometimes pass it. I think I have the other half of the Secret now, and I hope my reader can put both halves together.
