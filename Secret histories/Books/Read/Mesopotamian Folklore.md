A collection of folktales from the supposed cradle of civilisation, written by Sekt Kattan. The tales are written in an ancient Egyptian dialect, pointing towards the author being of its time.

One story is more striking than the rest. A story of a great prince in the guise of a great hooded serpent. He teaches the intricacies and clandestine arts which cannot be perceived to the masses to then later be invited to the great king of Najafâ€™s court. Yet he declines.

The story ends with the rise of a new lineage of kings within the city of Najaf as the great king has been found dead in the maw of countless serpents. The prince from the faraway land, never to be seen again, yet his influence forever remembered.
