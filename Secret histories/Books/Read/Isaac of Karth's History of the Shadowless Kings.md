Isaac of Karth's History of the Shadowless Kings

'A True and Accurate History of the Shadowless Kings, by Isaac of Karth.' Isaac describes the thousand-year ascendancy of the Shadowless Empire.

'The first and greatest history' is described herein. The Persian Empire - 'the sons of Achaemenes', 'the Shadowless Kings', 'the most Glorious Empire' - survives the assaults of Alexander the Great and flourishes as late as the fifth century.

After the fall of Rome, the Shadowless Empire takes Byzantium under its wing, and moves East against the Land of the Great River. Isaac begins to recount the invasion struggling against 'the unskinned armies of the hooded serpents', but ends abruptly with a series of incantations that he claims allowed the Shadowless Empire to persist.
