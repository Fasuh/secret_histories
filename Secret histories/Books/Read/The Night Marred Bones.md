#Moth #Ramsund #Read #Book 

A highly controversial book which sparked several occurrences of book burning mobs. Nobody knows, or maybe nobody remembers the identity of the writer anymore.

The page talks about a cast down [[Hours|Hour]] whom was born even before the [[gods-from-Light]]. The writer suggests that this was out of great fear and under the scheming suggestion of the Mountain Mother herself.

The hour known as [[The Blackbone]] - the tributary which endured - now influences those who listen from Nowhere. At the crushing black of the deep sea. The rising tide which may one day swallow that which consumes, for one cannot be sated by the sinking of ships alone.
