An account of the titular Red Sun written by an unknown author. The text is deeply wistful as if written from a faraway memory.

The writer seemingly reminisces of much colder times, where the sun was lower and the earth was colder. When the fluttering of wings was met with excitement and the chittering of legs was just as welcome. A time where all of the earth was ruled by only one.

‘The First Forbidden Act shattered the sky and the gentle glow of our Red Sun retreated into the far and blinding Glory. There we await the return of our sun. That which did not judge and will protect us. Remembering us in song.’
