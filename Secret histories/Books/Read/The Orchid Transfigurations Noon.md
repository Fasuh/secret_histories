Allows upgrade of [[Heart]]

gives skill: [[Maggephene Mysteries]]

Written in: [[Latin]]

The third volume of a compilation of quasi-Rosicrucian allegories, supposedly by Robert Fludd. This is in the original [[Latin]].

A long dialogue between the [[Mountain-Mother]] and the [[Vigilant Storm]] describes the ways in which both mountains and storms end, and the protections they use against those ends.

But we must use the knife,' said the [[Lion-Throned One]], 'the noose, the flame, the Waking Word, against those who have passed the [[Three-Valved Door]]. And so none may pass: that is our Law, and the [[Law of the Sun]].

Chilu notes: 
- [[Mountain-Mother]] probably refers to [[The Red Grail]]
- [[Vigilant Storm]] probably refers to [[The Horned-Axe]]
- [[Lion-Throned One]] probably refers to [[The Horned-Axe]]
- The conversation they are having sounds like they are talking about the skinning of [[The Thunderskin]]
- They have discovered how to kill [[Hours]], "where both mountains and storms end" could be a conversation about them dying.
- [[Three-Valved Door]] sounds like something important for killing [[Hours]] or at least reaching them.
