gives skill: [[Maggephene Mysteries]]

Written in: [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Languages/Latin]]

Read by: [[Tyr - Robert Whitehall, II]]

The third volume of a compilation of quasi-Rosicrucian allegories, supposedly by Robert Fludd. This is in the original [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Languages/Latin]].

A long dialogue between the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Mountain-Mother]] and the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Vigilant Storm]] describes the ways in which both mountains and storms end, and the protections they use against those ends.

But we must use the knife,' said the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Lion-Throned One]], 'the noose, the flame, the Waking Word, against those who have passed the [[Three-Valved Door]]. And so none may pass: that is our Law, and the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Law of the Sun]].

Chilu notes: 
- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Mountain-Mother]] probably refers to [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Red Grail]]
- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Vigilant Storm]] probably refers to [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/The Horned-Axe]]
- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Lion-Throned One]] probably refers to [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/The Horned-Axe]]
- The conversation they are having sounds like they are talking about the skinning of [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Thunderskin]]
- They have discovered how to kill [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Hours]], "where both mountains and storms end" could be a conversation about them dying.
- [[Three-Valved Door]] sounds like something important for killing [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Hours]] or at least reaching them.
