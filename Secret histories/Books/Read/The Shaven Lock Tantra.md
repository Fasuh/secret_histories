Also known as 'The One Who Has Shaven His Hair'. This, the story goes, is the lore that even the shapechanging Vanaras rejected.

The Tantra speaks glowingly of those who are prepared to abandon their old self to seek a new and higher self. It warns that once the change has truly begun - 'past the Third Mark' - a return to the old self is dangerous and painful.

'Whisper your secrets into the earth, burn them in fire, scatter them in the sea. Still they will cling to your hair,' the Tantra cautions. It provides an occult riddle that it claims is sometimes the answer to the Riddle of the Hunter's Gate.
