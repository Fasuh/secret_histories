The High Misteries

The secret rites of the Church of the Unconquered Sun, which held power in at least two Histories.

The Church chiefly worshipped the Sun-in-Splendour, the original undivided sun; but this text also includes the devotions of its aspects as the chilly winter dawn and the departing sunset, as well as the Meniscate, the Sun's 'night-self'. Priests of the Church were all male, but rites are also included which allowed women to cross ceremonially to manhood.

The Church's highest rites were performed in the Concursum, the chamber at the Mansus' heart where the Hours were known to pass. These rites include salutations to non-solar Hours: the Grail, the Ring-Yew, the Horned Axe and the Thunderskin.
