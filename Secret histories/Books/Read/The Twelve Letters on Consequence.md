Julian Coseley's epistolary treatise on 'what may come after', addressed to his once-friend Claude Hersault, the mystic and antiquarian.

By the time he wrote these letters, Coseley was identified with the oneiropolitical 'Worms' movement, and Hersault with the 'Birds' - meaning roughly that Hersault held the order of the Hours to be desirable, and Coseley held it to be oppressive.

Many of Coseley's arguments about consequence and finality are couched in erudite and practical alchemical terms. Others appear to be thinly-veiled threats directed at Hersault. Some are both.
