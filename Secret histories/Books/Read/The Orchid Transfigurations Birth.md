#Grail #Latin #Book 

Written in: [[Latin]]

The second volume of a compilation of quasi-Rosicrucian allegories, supposedly by Robert Fludd. This is in the original [[Latin]].

Fludd, or pseudo-Fludd, suggests alignments between the alchemical tradition of rubedo and the older [[Grail]] traditions, through the Pine-Knight's quest for the Cinnabar Cup.

Seek the Cup in the birthing-bed,' the [[Pine-Knight]] is told. The Midwife at the birthing-bed, to his amazement, is the [[Mountain-Mother]]. In a fit of awe, he both gelds and flays himself. The [[Vigilant Storm]] bursts joyfully from the remains.

Chilu notes:
- This book explains the slaying of [[The Thunderskin]] as spoiled by Namshiri.
- [[Pine-Knight]] probably refers to the [[The Thunderskin]]
- [[Mountain-Mother]] probably refers to [[The Red Grail]] who flayed [[The Thunderskin]]
- [[Vigilant Storm]] probably refers to [[The Horned-Axe]] who got placated by the skinning of [[The Thunderskin]]
