#Grail #Latin #Book 

Written in: [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Languages/Latin]]

The second volume of a compilation of quasi-Rosicrucian allegories, supposedly by Robert Fludd. This is in the original [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Languages/Latin]].

Fludd, or pseudo-Fludd, suggests alignments between the alchemical tradition of rubedo and the older [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Grail]] traditions, through the Pine-Knight's quest for the Cinnabar Cup.

Seek the Cup in the birthing-bed,' the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Pine-Knight]] is told. The Midwife at the birthing-bed, to his amazement, is the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Mountain-Mother]]. In a fit of awe, he both gelds and flays himself. The [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Vigilant Storm]] bursts joyfully from the remains.

Chilu notes:
- This book explains the slaying of [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Thunderskin]] as spoiled by Namshiri.
- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Pine-Knight]] probably refers to the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Thunderskin]]
- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Mountain-Mother]] probably refers to [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Red Grail]] who flayed [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Thunderskin]]
- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Vigilant Storm]] probably refers to [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/The Horned-Axe]] who got placated by the skinning of [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Thunderskin]]
