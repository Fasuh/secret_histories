Alexander Probst writes warily of 'Calyptra' - a law, principle or society which prevents the dissemination of dangerous knowledge.

'Calyptra, like the planet that occludes the star, or the Doylian dog that fails to bark, can be identified only by its absence. Even the name, I think, must be a maskâ€¦'

'Calyptra is said to make exceptions specifically for the libraries of the Watchman's Tree. Does it make those exceptions so the Hours can make use of them?'
