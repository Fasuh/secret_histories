Naturalistic film encompassing seven different deep forest areas around the world. Directed by Alisia Sulazzo, better known by her pen name - Poppy Queen.

The overarching theme of each of the pictures is the heavy presence of hornets. The whole film has an overwhelming sound of buzzing and the beating of wings. These sounds donâ€™t seem to quiet down even between cuts.

In the final minutes of the film, seemingly the Poppy Queen herself stands between swarms of hornets. Evoking the name of the Applebright in a condescending manner as her body bursts at various places with blood. Covering the swarm of hornets which causes them to feast upon their own nests. The forest grows darker suddenly as the Poppy Queen pulls a cup out from within her.
