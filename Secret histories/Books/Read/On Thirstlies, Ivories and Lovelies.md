Fionna Ayrshire recounts her visits in dreams to the 'Red Church' in the Mansus, and her conversations with the Names of the Grail.

An Hour, Ayrshire explains, may usually only have seven Names - but since the Thirstlies, Ivories and Lovelies who usually comprise the Red Grail's Names are constantly attempting to devour one another, and the Names of other Hours, that number fluctuates.

Lovelies, the 'freshest' of the Grail's Names, usually adopt the characteristics of whatever they devour - be it an Ivory, a Thirstly, or, occasionally, an entirely different kind of Name. A practical application of the principle is described. The arts of Resurgences and Emergences, in the presence of sufficiently potent Grail-aspect, can be used to feed a Pale Mommet to its successor-doll, creating something 'notably more avid'.
