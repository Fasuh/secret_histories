#Rose #Read #Book 

Manifesto for experimental and dangerous-sounding invocatory poetry, written some time in the nineteenth century by Dr Arun Peel. A notoriously inconsistent and incoherent text, apparently produced in a tearing hurry.

'The Hours have little time for poetry,' Dr Peel avers, 'but they have a tremendous amount of time for poets.'

As the Rose opens,' Dr Peel explains, 'an Enduring memory opens to the Horizon. This is a way of saying something that cannot otherwise be said, and is best only written with one's eyes firmly closed.'
