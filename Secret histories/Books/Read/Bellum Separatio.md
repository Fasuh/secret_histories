An experimental film about the changing borders of the countries over the centuries. A film which was apparently directed by a Name of the Vagabond - Rhodope.

The film shows the current geographical presentation of the world. It swiftly changes however to seemingly nonsensical separations, cutting many countries into several pieces, shifting landmasses and adding seas in peculiar places.

Soon Rhodope points towards an uncharacteristic map of Egypt. Slowly painting in the river Nile through the whole landmass. He proclaims that the Nile is sacred, for it is not merely painted by the Vagabond, but it has ushered forth her friend of the roost as well. The Twins.
