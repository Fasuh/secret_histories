A wonderful compendium of healing tisanes compiled by Natan of Regensburg.

Natan and his family sought sanctuary at Brancrug but were confined to the Barber's Tower (as it was then known) by the suspicions of the monks, but won more freedom over timeâ€¦

Natan records his delight on the day he was finally permitted access to Earl Brian's Meadow. He speaks very carefully of the black bird he met in its branches, and the 'treasures of music and history' that it brought him when he healed its wing.
