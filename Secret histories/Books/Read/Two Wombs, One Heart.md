A fanciful account by Thirza Blake of the early life of the Twins - their time as mortals before they became Hours or even Long, in a 'dry kingdom beyond the Western Sea' which Thirza suggests might have been ancient Mexico.

'It is widely known that the Sister was rich and the Witch poor. It is widely known that the Witch loved the Sister first. It is not widely known that the Witch was first employed to teach the Sister the arts of embroideryâ€¦'

Although Thirza is very probably just making up much of the story, there are long passages expounding notable techniques of weave-work and thread-feit. In particular, when Witch and Sister flee across the Sea to be together, Thirza explains how they fashioned a 'peace-weave' with Heart and these arts, and then, to tame the winds, called on Heart again to swaddle the thunder in the peace-weave.
