"Rather curious book translated into many different languages across the ages. The original work has been long lost and this volume has been transcribed in [[Coptic]] from many other source books. The nuances of the book are most likely lost.

The unknown author talks about winged creatures who populated the Wake before the humans. Worshipping the [[Hours]] whom were [[gods-from-stone]], and sought after the Monarch-at-the-Crossroads. Wishing to be led diligently in their fervour.

The Monarch was found and so the Cross looked inwards. Knowing that their taste and bite could turn maws to mouth and wings to arms. When the [[gods-from-stone]] were defeated, they followed their leaderâ€™s instinct and feasted upon the upright apes. Passing onto humanity."
