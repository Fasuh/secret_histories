A play dealing with the nine-year sojourn of a [[gods from nowhere/Snow|snow*]]-goddess in the Thracian city of [[Abydos]], by 'Apollo Fireweaver'. In English, published in 1892; purportedly from an older [[Greek]] text.

The entity called '[[Chione]]' arrives in a blizzard and demands the city gates are barred. As [[Abydos]] falls under her spell, the [[Dead]] return, but do not speak...

For eight years the city is a place of slow death, frosty ecstacy and silent beauty, but in the ninth year a Conspiracy of Shouts is mounted against the quiet that [[Chione]] demands. The conspirators open the city gates, and a [[Colonel|scarred man*]] comes to drag [[Chione]] out by the hair. Summer returns, but the conspirators die of remorse.

Chilu notes:
- Snow-goddess could refer to [[gods from nowhere/Snow]] who is one of [[gods from nowhere/gods-from-Nowhere]]
- [[Chione]] is probably the name of the snow-goddess
- [[Chione]] spell makes dead return but they are unable to speak.
- [[Chione]] was taken by a scarred man. [[Colonel]] is often called The Scarred Hour
- We could assume [[Chione]] is a part of if not a whole of [[Seven Coils]] as mentioned by [[Ms Azita Bukhara]]
- [[Conspiracy of Shouts]] could be something worth asking [[Ms Azita Bukhara]]
