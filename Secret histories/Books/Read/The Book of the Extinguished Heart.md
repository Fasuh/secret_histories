In the days of the Shadowless Kings, Ennis Lazali was executed for prophesying the Division of the Sun. If any of his captors grew Long, they probably feel rather abashed now.

Lazali indicates that the Sun will be divided in the Malleary, by the Forge of Days, armed with the love in her heart.

'Love will not be the cause of the Sun's death, but rather envy. Envy will not be the cause of the Sun's death, but rather thirst. Thirst shall not be the cause of his death, but curiosity. Curiosity shall not be his end; rather will it be love.'
