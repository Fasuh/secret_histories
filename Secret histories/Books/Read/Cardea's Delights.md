Written in: [[Latin]]

The third volume of [[Abbot Geffrey]]'s hypothetical theological dialogues in the Socratic mode. If [[Janus]] were an [[Hours|Hour]], [[Cardea]] might be counted among his [[Names]], but the world has never turned in such a manner, and so and she is notâ€¦

[[Abbot Geffrey|Geffrey]] discusses the 'living Signs' -signs which change their shape, and whose flexibility is part of what makes it identifiable. He gives as one example 'the [[Paradox of the Hinge]]', and draws comparisons with the '[[Names]]' called [[The Twins]] (who would be considered [[Hours]] beyond the [[Church of the Unconquered Sun|Church]]).

He hints at the '[[Amethyst Vessel]]' which can be sanctified by the [[The Great Signs and the Great Scars]] in the presence of [[Knock]]...

Chilu notes:
- [[Janus]] is _not_ an [[Hours|Hour]]
- This book contains a [[Crafting Recipes|crafting recipe]] that lets you sanctify [[Amethyst Vessel]] using [[Knock]] and [[The Great Signs and the Great Scars]]
- [[The Twins]] are not considered [[Hours]] within [[Church of the Unconquered Sun|Church]]
- [[Paradox of the Hinge]] is mentioned
