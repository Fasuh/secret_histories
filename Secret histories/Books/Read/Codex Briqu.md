An unusually thick tome which holds a lengthy dialogue between two heart-longs. Occasionally the pages are unusually dry with small-talk and riddled with colloquialisms and phrases now lost to time.

The book recounts the tale of the Pine Knight and the Midwife. How love immemorial and immortal may exist even through the horrific machinations of the Cinnabar Cup.

The two long afterwards go into a lengthy and rather impassioned ridicule about the Midwife. Reciting and retelling rumours heard from the Wood about her secret and furthermore, forbidden love with a god-from-nowhere whom they speculate as being the Mare.
