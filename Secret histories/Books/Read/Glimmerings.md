An anonymous prison diary written by a dreamer convicted of 'oneiric irresponsibility' and confined to the Cucurbit.

The prisoner is plainly terrified and bewildered by their situation, and has been unable to wrangle a coherent explanation out of anyone. But the dreams keep coming, and they keep writing them downâ€¦

[[Snow]]; broken mirrors; half-heard sky music; [[Lesson of the White Flower|flowers of white]], [[Lesson of the Red Flower|red]] and black; a blood-streaked winter dawn... the most notorious signifiers of oneiric risk, fantastically vivid and detailed. No wonder they were locked up. Their final recorded dream is of a 'worm-jewel' beneath Brancrug Isle, which they open with a key carved from their finger-bone.
