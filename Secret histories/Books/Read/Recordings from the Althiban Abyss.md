Recordings from a subterranean space in the mountains near Baghdad of 'conversations' between the entomologist Juliana Zawistowski and an unidentified presence.

Only Zawistoski's part in the 'conversations' is comprehensible to the listener. The other side consists of grating, buzzing and rumbling sounds, perhaps only rock movements or artifacts of the recording process, which Zawistoski nevertheless unhesitatingly translates.

Zawistoski seems to believe that the presence identifies itself as a Name or remnant of the lost Hour called Seven-Coils. It pleads with her to assist its rebirth; it begs her to find something for it in the city of Emesa. Towards the end of the interview, Zawistoski grows suspicious, and repeatedly accuses the presence of being not the Seven-Coils at all - only 'an inhabitant.' The recording ends in mid-sentence.
