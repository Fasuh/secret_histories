Supposedly copied from a tablet of green jasper which serves as the Covenant-stone of the Monastery of the Fifth Cup - the token which gives that Library shelter beneath the Watchman's Tree.

Humankind hid itself from the Glory's light in the Roots of the Watchman's Tree. But for every chink we stuffed with cloth and hair, we opened another, and the light crept in. Until we looked below, into Nowhere, and the Eye of the Mare-in-the-Tree winked Red...

The Tablet expounds the dangers of inviting in the Nowhere-Hour called the Mare-in-the-Tree, and also of forbidding her entry, since she can never entirely be denied. Along the way, it reveals the secret of the Sacrament Malachite ('in which the merry Mare merrily spits') - brewed with the Rites of the Roots from the numa-pear, in the presence of sufficient Nectar-aspect.
