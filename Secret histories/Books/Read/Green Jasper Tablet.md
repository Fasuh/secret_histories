Supposedly copied from a tablet of green jasper which serves as the Covenant-stone of the Monastery of the Fifth Cup - the token which gives that Library shelter beneath the [[Watchman Tree|Watchman's Tree]].

Humankind hid itself from the [[Secret Histories/Influences/Flowers/Glory]]'s light in the Roots of the [[Watchman Tree|Watchman's Tree]]. But for every chink we stuffed with cloth and hair, we opened another, and the light crept in. Until we looked below, into [[Nowhere]], and the Eye of the [[Mare-in-the-Tree]] winked Red...

The Tablet expounds the dangers of inviting in the [[Nowhere]]-[[Hours|Hour]] called the [[Mare-in-the-Tree]], and also of forbidding her entry, since she can never entirely be denied. Along the way, it reveals the secret of the Sacrament Malachite ('in which the merry Mare merrily spits') - brewed with the [[Rites of the Roots]] from the numa-pear, in the presence of sufficient [[Nectar]]-aspect.
