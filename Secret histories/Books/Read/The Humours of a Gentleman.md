Samuel Savage's satirical comedy, on the intrigues of the ailing, but cunning John Sonne, his mistress Maevelin, her lover Leo, and the upstart Corvino.

By the end of the first act, Maevelin has revealed a secret door in the walls of the House to Leo, and Corvino has taken to consuming Worms.

The play is scabrous and occasionally hilarious. The characters are contrary and capricious. Many of the more resonant lines might well be formulae of power, disguised in plain sight.
