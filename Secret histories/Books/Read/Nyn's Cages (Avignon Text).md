The 'merciful measures of the witch Nyn.

Nyn's stated aim was to 'keep beyond the Walls of Sleep that business which should not trouble the world'. This includes fever, madness and delirium, as well as spirits identified as 'Devourers' and 'Deceivers'.

Nyn warns against cutting hair, cracking mirrors, spilling blood, or invoking the Edicts Liminal or Inviolable before sleep - 'for no matter how secure a lock may be, key will surely open it.'
