A diatribe by Hokobald of Pocsind, formerly of the order of immortals called the House of Lethe (later the Ordo Limiae; much latter the Obliviates). He has scores to settle.

Hokobald boasts of his royal descent, and insists that the magics of the Forge are more effective when practised by those of noble blood.

Pocsind complains of his condemnation by the Ordo Limiae. He acknowledges that he has 'undergone alterations' after the 'consummation of that particular delight', but insists that these changes are both elegant and inevitable. 'Who is the fire, and who the fuel?' he asks rhetorically.
