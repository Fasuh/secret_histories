An especially repugnant book which describes various ways to consume humans and preparing them for consumption. Written by the infamous Nectar-long Huldra.

Each page is more repulsive than the last. It goes into meticulous and diligent details about Huldraâ€™s methods. Each page holds a dreadful sensation of deep apathy and a harsh bluntness about the methodology.

Huldra finally talks about the Crime of the Sky itself. How she had consumed her own children to attain greater heights of power in the invisible arts and how it allowed her to rise above the ranks of a Long and become a Name of an hour. She does not disclose whom that hour may be.
