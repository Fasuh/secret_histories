A surprisingly chatty text by an entity that identifies itself as 'the Excellency Gnathobasis'.

The Excellency Gnathobasis explains the 'limbs and extensions' of potent and dangerous 'glyphic achievements'. The sentences are nonsense on first reading, but quickly acquire an insistent meaning on each repetition.

'With adequate Grail,' the Excellency Gnathobasis explains, 'the [[Pale Mommet]] wakes to life. With generous Grail, the [[Flushed Mommet]] accepts our beneficence. It may be necessary to overcome scruple! The Excellency Gnathobasis will assure you as to how, and to whom, and with which most perfect instrument.'
