Hymns attributed to Saint Lucia the Eyeless, patron of glassworkers and Name of the Hour called Meniscate.

The hymns venerate every sanctioned Hour, celebrating them as the Sun Undivided, but also suggesting that each Hour may become the next - Madrugad to Watchman, Watchman to Wolf, and so on.

The Hymn of the Phases celebrates the Meniscate 'from whom we do not turn', for the truth which is beauty, the beauty which is truth, and the perfect balance between the two. The Hymn of the Reflections, more puzzlingly, celebrates the Meniscate as the 'Sister of Janus, Mother of Shadow', whose 'visage wondrous in emptiness' can reveal all truths.
