[[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Musgrave]], fourth of the [[The Dewulf Line]] line, writes tentatively about the '[[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Covenant of Brancrug]]' and the legacy of the sacred inks he calls '[[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/encausta revelationia]]' Words are of the First Importance.

So the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Book of Suns]] teaches. But do not Words require Ink? And is the Inkwell not then the Womb of Words? [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Musgrave]] identifies 'the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Ichor Auroral]]' as the mother of the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Encaustum Porphyrine]].

He adds that it would be blasphemous to describe the origins of the Ichor itself, although a scrawled marginal note suggests a later reader thought [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Musgrave]] was only hiding his ignorance beneath a cloak of piety.
