[[Musgrave]], fourth of the [[The Dewulf Line]] line, writes tentatively about the '[[Covenant of Brancrug]]' and the legacy of the sacred inks he calls '[[encausta revelationia]]' Words are of the First Importance.

So the [[Book of Suns]] teaches. But do not Words require Ink? And is the Inkwell not then the Womb of Words? [[Musgrave]] identifies 'the [[Ichor Auroral]]' as the mother of the [[Encaustum Porphyrine]].

He adds that it would be blasphemous to describe the origins of the Ichor itself, although a scrawled marginal note suggests a later reader thought [[Musgrave]] was only hiding his ignorance beneath a cloak of piety.

Chilu notes:
- [[Book of Suns]] is mentioned multiple times for example in [[Wolf Stories]]
- This book contains a [[Crafting Recipes|crafting recipe]]
