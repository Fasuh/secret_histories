The 'Barrowchild', a nameless Gaulish adept who joined an organisation identified as the Ordo Limiae, writes regretfully of the destruction of the gods-who-were-stone - the Hours who preceded humanity.

The Barrowchild singles out the Scarred Tribune, the Red Grail, the Forge and the Moth for especial condemnation as murderers of the first gods. 'We live in the shadow of their crime', she writes, 'and we must evade it or repeat it.'

The Barrowchild describes how the Grail drained the Hour called Tide, how the Moth 'usurped the Wheel from within', stealing its skin, and how the Forge first eclipsed then shattered Flint. 'Perhaps these are glories,' she observes, 'but then it cannot be that Glory is merciful.'
