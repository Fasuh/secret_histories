Crudely restored codex which some believe was recovered from the Library of Alexandria. The codex was transposed into its original coptic and describes the event of Echidna’s seduction.

The unknown author describes at length about the Mother of Monsters. The children she birthed and the children she has won. The accounts are written almost in a kind of religious reverence of her and the Lionsmith’s relation as well. As if the writer was themselves seduced.

The final accounts are Echidna’s encounter with the Milk-Thief. The jealous priestess seduces the Mother of Monsters, gaining enough admiration by her to be lent the Hissing Key. This marked the ascension of the Key-Serpent after the Scarred Hour.
