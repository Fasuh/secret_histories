Cassius the Thoman reveals the deeds of the Unnumbered Legion, the secret army that protected Rome against the Shadowless Empire.

The Legion's Legate answered directly to the Hour called the Tribune of Scars, and was promised immortality if he died in battle....

In the final part, Cassius confesses to being a former Legate. He recounts his terror of the Tribune, and divulges the secret lore of the Golden General, the champion of the Shadowless Empire, the enemy of the Tribune, in the hope that the Tribune will some day be undone.
