Black Elie, who much later became Damascene Matriarch of the [[Sisterhood of the Knot]], recounts her journey to the Grove of Green Immortals.

In the Grove, Elie meets with an entity identified as '[[Three Faces|Three Faces, Nine Colours]]' - who may have become her lover.

[[Three Faces]] is a name of the [[Applebright]], the [[Nowhere]] Hour of youth, healing and mutation. It offers Elie a form of eternal youth to take back West with her, which she rejects for certain reasons. She does promise, however, to renew their acquaintance 'in the season when the [[Applebright]] is the [[The Witch-and-Sister|Witch]]' - not from sentiment, but rather grandly, to ensure the continuity of the [[Histories]].
