'Once in the Wood, we call a visit. Twice in the Wood, we call a journey. Thrice, we call coming home.'

'Every timber has its knots, the straight and the crooked both. Every weave is more absence than thread. You can't keep Nowhere out any more than you can keep Somewhere inâ€¦'

'When the cuckoo learns the nightingale's song, our sleep is sweeter than honey.'
