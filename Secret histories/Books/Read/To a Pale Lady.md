A collection of Franklin Bancroft's letters to Eva Dewulf.

There is a substantial body of erotic pleading and half-finished poetry, but also learned discursions on matters mythical and marine, as well as notes towards a comic opera on which Franklin and Eva were apparently collaborating.

‘Do not return, O my Light, to the Sea. None of us can be what we were; that is History’s curse. None of us know what we may be; that is History’s gift. Your mothers, and the mothers of your mothers, are caught in Eternity’s jaws like a robe-hem in a trap. It is the pearl that shines; but the tide that returns.’
