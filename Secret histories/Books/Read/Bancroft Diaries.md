Lord Franklin Bancroft was initiated into the arts of [[The Flowermaker]] by the 'rose-witch' Fionna Ayrshire. He rose to become a Society provider of occult services and secret pleasures, before his abrupt disappearance in 1790.

Bancroft seems to have been a talented adept, but devoted his energies to frustratingly whimsical projects: arranging 'grape-fetching races' between [[Mansus]]-spirits, teaching [[Percussigant]]s to juggle, and conjuring storms of imaginary blossoms for the rose-witch Ayrshire, who resolutely refused ever to couple with him. Bancroft spends twenty pages bemoaning this last.

The Mantra here recorded is a high and exacting magic which can be used to pledge one's spirit to [[The Watchman]], beginning an ascent to the House. Bancroft boasts of his ability to recite it when in his cups. He also had it set to music for a performance with fireworks at Vauxhall Gardens.
