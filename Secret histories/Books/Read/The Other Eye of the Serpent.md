In which the heresiarch Cygnifer attempts to resolve certain mysteries of Lightning.

Cygnifer considers Lightning to be 'the division, the connection, the joined serpent.' The Serpent's Eye is said to be the Sun - but as the division and connection, it must have a second Eye.

Cygnifer considers and rejects, three times, the hypothesis that the Moon is the Serpent's other eye, insisting that it and the Sun do not share a nature. (This, as much as the Serpent business, is what got him burnt by the Church.) He proposes that the Serpent's teeth are towers, that the Serpent's mouth is a gate, that the Serpent is the 'devourer of Ys'... and 'therefore' that the Serpent's other eye is amber.
