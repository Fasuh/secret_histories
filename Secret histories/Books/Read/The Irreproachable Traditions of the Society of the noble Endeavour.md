The Irreproachable Traditions of the Society of the Noble Endeavour. In Akkadian.

The Irreproachable Traditions of the Society of the Noble Endeavour. The members of the Society of the Noble Endeavour adopted noble names at their initiation: 'Parsival', 'Roland', 'Ois√≠n'. They drew their inspiration from the Leashed Flame, which gave the island of Britain such appalling power in some histories. One Samuel Partridge has chronicled their efforts.

Their 'Endeavour' was no less noble - a furious arcane conflagration which would refine them into something more than human. But such transformations are rare, and they often ended, less nobly, in ashes. Partridge claims to have identified consistent features among those who ascended. All of them had passed the Stag Door, and were accounted Know. All of them spoke the Callidate Invocation, or a greater rite, at the start of their ascension. And all of them were rich.
