An old codex which details the necessity of the Intercalate by an anonymous author.

Many chapters talk about the insatiable desire for all Long to commit the Crime of the Sky. A burden which was shackled upon the Long as punishment by the gods-from-stone for the Crime of the Earth.

The author goes on to explain why many Long still decide to copulate with others. Their point concludes with the simple fact that those Long who possess someone inexplicably loyal and ensorcelled by them may harness this emotion to further fuel the invisible arts. This kind of emotional prowess comes with its own toll though. For no man or woman, may ascend beyond the Peacock Gate if their heart is strung up by another. To pass beyond, one must commit their own Intercalate.
