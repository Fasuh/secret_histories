A very heterodox history of the [[House of Lethe]] as recorded by 'the [[Serenity]]' - a [[House of Lethe|Lethean]] adept who declares that the [[House of Lethe]] was created explicitly to prevent the ascension of any more mortals to [[Names|Name]] or [[Hours|Hour]] status.

‘[[Eternity]] cannot be escaped; but in [[Histories|History]], it may be delayed,’ the [[Serenity]] explains. ‘The [[gods-who-were-flesh]], by their nature, are a surrender to [[Eternity]].’

The 'roots of the House' are said to pass into the [[Wood]] of dreams through three forests in the [[The Bounds|Bounds]], identified as the [[The Three Forests of the Bounds|Bei Ilai]], the [[The Three Forests of the Bounds|Black Cedar Forest]], and the [[The Three Forests of the Bounds|Brecheliant]]. 'While one tree of these may yet stand, one single tree, the [[Histories]] continue.

Chilu notes:
- [[House of Lethe]] was created to prevent ascension
- [[Eternity]] seems to affect [[gods-who-were-flesh]] but in [[Histories]] its delayed
- [[The Three Forests of the Bounds]] are mentioned here: Bei Ilai, Black Cedar Forest and Brecheliant.
- As long as those forests exist at all the [[Histories]] will continue
