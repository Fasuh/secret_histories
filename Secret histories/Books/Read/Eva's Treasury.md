Eva Dewulf, last of the Brancrugs, discusses the occult and aesthetic properties of jewels and other precious minerals.

Black nephrite and scolecite, for Nowhere; orichalc and amber, for Ys; amethyst for the Night Key of the Spider Door...

Eva points out - bitterly? - that there is no shortage of uplifting parables and proverbs about the saving graces of a flaw in a jewel; but that no-one, 'not jeweller, not priest, not Hour' has ever found a way to repair such a flaw.
