#Nectar #Latin #Read #Book 

An occasionally coherent catalogue of the secret gods, organised by hour. This is a reprint, but in the original Latin.

This volume deals mostly with the Hours of the Wood: the Moth, the Black-Flax, the Ring-Yew, among others.

The Glory is a question, and the Moth always answers 'Yes'.'
