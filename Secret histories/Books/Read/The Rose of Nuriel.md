A volume of collected teachings of the Sisterhood of the Knot, that arcane-contemplative order that existed in all histories, but in some was very powerful indeed. This was recorded by 'Nuriel', and dedicated to St Tryphon.

St Tryphon, Nuriel explains, performed secret miracles in the name of 'She who Bleeds and Bears and 'She who Opens'. Thus St Tryphon opened the way to the House of the Sun; thus St Tryphon underwent the Great Birth, an ascension to immortality.

St Tryphon began his ascension by passing the 'Horned Door'. St Tryphon continued his ascension by learning the 'Invocation Thiatic' - which Nuriel does not here record, on account of its extreme holiness. And, Nuriel explains grimly, to achieve the Seven Marks of the Great Birth, St Tryphon consumed 'those whose soul had left them, and even those in whom the soul remained.'
