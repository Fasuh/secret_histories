A book describing various blades of grass which surrounded the borders of the Shadowless Empire. The author identifies themselves as Magor, a Name of the Colonel.

Magor explains his many trials and wars which he waged against the west. His long conquest swaths through the steppes, cutting people down in his wake. Blood sustaining the vicious ground where swords landed to never be picked up. Scars filling up his body where he needed no more weapons to wield.

He remarks upon Corrivality's curiosity. How even the most unassuming of men may become one’s true rivals. Remarking with both amusement and dread how his brother’s child Attila, would become his undying rival for the rest of his life. How even a singular grass is called a blade. This is the Edge-Dyad. The Strife Imperishable. The war without end.
