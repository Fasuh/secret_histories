Micah Xi, sometimes called the Magus of Quartz, etched this work in acid on stone. It has been reproduced many times in many languages since, but the reproductions are often lost to landslides.

Xi describes the rites of the gods-who-were-stone, the first Hours, as practiced before the existence of human civilisation by the 'Carapace Cross'. He claims a final survivor of the Cross shared the information with him.

The rites are largely obsolete now. Few have been observed, in the last thousand years at least, to have any effect at all. Nevertheless, Xi identifies at least one invocation of particular power. He warns that it should be used with caution, lest the gods-who-were-stone might find their way back from Nowhere.
