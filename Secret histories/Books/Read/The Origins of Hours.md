The sage and ecstatic Soham, a frequent visitor to the Mansus, claimed to have discoursed with the Beachcrow in person. Soham later insisted on a sky-burial.

Soham's writings veer from poetry to confession. He identifies from flesh (those who were mortal), from blood (those who arose from sacrifice), from Light (entry from the Glory) and from stone (those who arose before his knowledge.) He insists that the Moth was the first god-who-was-blood, but later contradicts himself and claims it was the Red Grail.

'The Mansus was different before the first god came from Light, but never doubt it existed, even then.'
