A fable of the eponymous White Lady of Krakow. Thought to be a Name of the hour known as the Beachcomber.

The story goes that the White Lady was a well travelled woman who came to learn many lessons and knowledge which she could attain with her lady-like wiles. Her affairs were many and her lovers even more. When her father - the count- found out about her deed, he was deeply disappointed and arranged for her execution. The Beachcomber, whose most praised treasure is the Secret Couplings, visits the White Lady in her prison.

The two exchange a mirriad of secrets. Known and unknown. Some being told by words, others by song, a few by dance and some through passion. As the dawn rises above the horizon, and the father and executioner open the cell, both their white garbs turn to red. The White Lady was never seen, ever again. In her place, only a strange and Paradoxical Curio left.
