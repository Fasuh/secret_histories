A disgraceful compendium of ribald poetry about the habits and corruptions of Henry VIII.

Henry's 'Great Misfortune' - his crushing injury at a jousting bout - has left him unable to stand 'any straighter than a splintered withy'â€¦

The most savage mockery is reserved for Henry's 'Great Debasement', where the corruption of his softer metal is supposed to have crept into the coin of the realm. The last and most serious lampoon makes seditious references to 'the Crucible Revolution'.
