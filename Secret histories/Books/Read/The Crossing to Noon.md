The mystic Garcia Sauri gives a picaresque account of the adventures of Franklin Bancroft, 'Prince of Wines', and Eva Dewulf, 'the Pale Lady', on their way to the hidden island of Noon.

For a long long time the Blackbone pondered her next move, until the Moon dared to peep from behind a cloud, and the Prince completed the composition of his third sestina. But the Lady met the blind gaze of its open pores, waiting for the tide…

Garcia Sauri acknowledges in an epilogue that it is widely known that Eva in fact tragically drowned herself - and her twin infant grand-daughters - without ever making such a journey. But he adds contemptuously: 'it is also widely known that the City Unbuilt will so remain, that only one History is ever written, and that Janus is a Mansus-prank.
