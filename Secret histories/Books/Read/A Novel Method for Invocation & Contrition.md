#Rose #Book 

Ingenious and rather beautiful techniques for entreating the [[Names]] of the [[Hours]], developed by Rory Morrow, who styled himself 'the Sage-Knight'.

The techniques rely on the unique qualities of the [[Ericapaean]] tongue. Morrow professes himself surprised that they serve better to entreat the [[Names]] of [[The Vagabond]] than the [[Names]] of [[Lantern]] or [[Winter]] [[Hours]]â€¦

Morrow demonstrates that [[Preliminal Meter]] techniques can be used with sufficient [[Rose]] to invoke the [[The Vagabond|Vagabond]]'s [[Names]], transforming an [[Enduring Reflection]] into 'something wider of sky.'

Chilu Notes:
- This is a recipe for [[Horizon sight]]
