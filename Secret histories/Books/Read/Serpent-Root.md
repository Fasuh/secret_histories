A mass of root-stock, shiny with age but still somehow viable. Tiny spidery scratchings, marked with embedded egg-shell shards, encode a cryptic message.

'Sea-born, tide-drawn, Meniscate-sister, Witch-lover. The House of the Moon will always have its messenger, though its messenger is different each time, in eye and flesh and heartâ€¦'

Feits, feats, posterns, loopholes, set down against the advent of Eternity by powers favouring imperfection and impermanence.
