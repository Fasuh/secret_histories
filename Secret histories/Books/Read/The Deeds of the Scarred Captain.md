Painstakingly assembled by the soldier of fortune and sometime remittance man, Pavel Shulga, during his years in Greece.

An account of the founding of Mycenae by a 'Scarred Captain' who first slew seven monsters to make the land safe.

As the Captain destroys each monster, a flood of blood rises higher, until at last a priestess drowns and is reborn as a serpent-goddess. She blesses the Captain, and he departs for the 'House above the Forest', leaving Mycenae to reign supreme after the flood of blood subsides.
