The seventeenth-century mystic and antiquarian Claude Hersault describes divergent incidents in five major Histories.

The prologue warns at length of the iniquities of one Julian Coseley, a former colleague who Hersault now describes darkly as 'a Worm of Worms'. It seems Coseley advised Hersault early in the writing of the book, but Hersault later became suspicious.

Hersault identifies Blood, Silver, Design and the Worms as the central axes of each of the Histories, and claims that the so-called Second History is the true one.
