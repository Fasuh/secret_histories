Already has been read by Vana, rewarded us with a choice of:

- Teach someone [[Wolf Stories]]

Was used to teach Vonte [[Wolf Stories]]

Van Driel describes odd events in [[Vienna]] - the disappearance of children; epidemics of parasite activity; animal mutilations; nightmares of [[Worms]]; the activities of a charitable organization, the New [[Ligeians]], that funds the burial of the poor. She proposes peculiar connections between these activities.

When the individual K. attends the meetings, black dogs are sacrificed and quartered. When the element M. is in attendance, black mares are found with their throats slashed. I propose that these sacrifices are not necessary, but that our [[Ligeians|Ligeian]] friends may consider them 'fitting'. 

Herewith diagrams of the mutilations -'[[Medusa's Riddle]], then, I choose to render as 'What is Not Seen?' There is another riddle, one I have heard rendered as 'What may be Lost?' I will delineate some historic attempts to answer it- these are in themselves, in some sense, sacrifices - '

Chilu notes:
- Nightmares of [[Worms|Worms]] could mean the worms that live [[Nowhere]]
- New [[Ligeians]] is curious because as far as we know theres only seven [[Ligeians]]
- Individual K. could mean one of [[Ligeians]]
- [[Medusa's Riddle]] is mentioned.
