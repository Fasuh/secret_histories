Eva Dewulf discurses on the Fifth History, and particularly on those who are said to have 'passed over' from it - the Great Hooded Princes, the Knock-long who ascended under the Mother of Ants but now (so Eva claims) honour the Horned-Axe.

'The Great Hooded Princes call their library the Tomb of Lies, and this has given rise to a foolish tradition that the Princes are habitual liars. Of course, in fact, Truth flourishes when Lies are slain. On the other hand, the Princes do not say 'Knowledge is Power', but rather, 'Power is Knowledge.'

Eva has, to her regret, never visited the Library. She notes that it is said to be 'west of the Lion, and north of Victory' - and suggests that, although the Princes are generally associated with India, their library might be farther Eastâ€¦
