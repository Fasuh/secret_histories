Bryan [[The Dewulf Line]], the son of the 3rd Baron [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Covenant of Brancrug|Brancrug*]], gives advice on hunting in the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/The Bounds]].

It is clear from Bryan's journals that he sought unorthodox trophies and put them to unorthodox uses. He was in fact hung as a witch at the age of tweny-four, and never inherited the estateâ€¦

Bryan describes how a 'Sky-inspired fife' can be prepared using these [[Furs & Feathers|Fur and Feathers]] techniques, in the presence of greater [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Sky]]-aspect, to 'make of the winds good neighbours.' It's a powerful technique to be described so casually: Brian's main interest seems to be in ensuring good weather for his hunts.

Chilu notes:
- This book contains a [[Crafting Recipes|crafting recipe]] explaining how to prepare "sky-inspired fife" using [[Furs & Feathers]] with [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Sky]]
