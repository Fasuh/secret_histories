Thirza Blake, seventh librarian of Hush House, talks about fruit. For no other apparent reason but that it was the kind of thing she did, she talks about fruit in the woven language Killasimi.

'Who was it once said, fruit is the womb of a plant? It was me. Take a few moments to think on that enripened wisdom. I shall leave a blank space for your moments, here in this page.

Nectar, children mine - cast my words into a sufficiency of Nectar and watch the pyrus pyrissimus burst from wood. Gather more Nectar! Wring it from the trees and earth! And our pyrissimus gushes forth the Sacrament! You will thank me.'
