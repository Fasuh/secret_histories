#Moth #Arameic #Book  

An account of an occult romance. A certain Para, son of Aaron, claims to have written this in a single night as part of his initiation into the Damascene branch of the House of Lethe - that order of immortals who rejected their past and future.

The laws of the House forbade Matthias to love. The customs of the Wood forbade the Imago to remain. So he conjured her a final time, when she had uncovered the Shears of Alakapura; and she suffered him to cut the wings from her back, so that she might remain; and he suffered her to cut the parts which hold man's seed, to keep them from the Detestable Act. This was love in all its blood and joy. We have cast out Matthias from the House.    â€ž

In the cradle of the roots, Matthias and the Imago left their names, and though their names were lost, they found their Nameday Riddles. This we recall in Solution and Separation, so that in the presence of the Moth our memories may become our futures. Do this wisely, in memory of the Name and the Long who gave up their past that they might be together forgotten.
