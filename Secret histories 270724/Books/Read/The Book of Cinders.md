Cost [[Shilling]]

Already has been read by [[Neyra - Erich Albert Tonius]], rewarded us witha choice of:
- upgrade any [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Forge]] Skill
- Teach someone [[Pyroglyphics]]

Was used to teach [[Neyra - Erich Albert Tonius]] [[Pyroglyphics]]

Ostensibly an eighteenth-century fireworks manual, but with some exotic ingredient choices and a substantial section on 'teframancy', divination from ashes.

The text takes as its theme the motto of the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Society of the Noble Endeavour]], ALITUR PROPRIIS IGNIS CINERIBUS - 'a fire by its own ashes is nourished', and uses this as a way into discussions of alchemical techniquesâ€¦

A surprisingly casual final section mentions that iotic essence, 'the root of the Great and Exultant Ink Orpimental', can be refined with enough [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Forge]] from a variety of liquids.

Chilu notes:
- This book contains a [[Crafting Recipes|crafting recipe]] explaining that you can refine iotic essence using [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Forge]] and maybe [[Purifications & Exaltations]]
