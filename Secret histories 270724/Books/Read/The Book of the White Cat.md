Stories brought by a blind white cat to Penelope of Gordion.

The aviform Hours - the Crow, the Laughingthrush, the Dove, and the twin Kites - have been known to meet in the mountains north of Gordion, at a place called the Roost, to exchange gossip. Penelope indicates that mortals who hear their words directly are obliterated, but claims that her cat goes unnoticed and returns to her with rumours from the Hours' meetings.

The stories that Penelope claims as Hour-gossip are fragmentary and confusing: accounts of contests where Hope and Dread and the Shadowless Empire are used as game-pieces, agendas of ruin and remembrance from no known history. The most interesting element is the protective incantation she records at the end of the book, after she worries that the Hours might in fact learn of her spying.
