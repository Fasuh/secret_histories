An unreleased volume of the Pine-Knight’s tale. The lack of publication of it most likely being that it was not written by the original author, and rather by someone using the pen name - Poppy Queen.

This tale instead of focusing on the Pine-Knight’s love for the Midwife goes into gratuitous detail between an apparent love affair that was held between the Mountain-Mother and the Pine-Knight. Their love for each other drowning into incessant lust and later, debauchery.

The author almost mockingly berates the Pine-Knight later for losing the passion for the Mountain-Mother and instead trying to give his heart to the Midwife. Questioning if the Knight was ever truly able to tell apart his own lust from true love. For whom would ever deny the love of the Cinnabar Cup?
