Gideon [[The Dewulf Line]], 5th Baron [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Covenant of Brancrug|Brancrug*]], discusses techniques shared between medical suturing, tailoring, and - carefully, allusively - the binding of restless spirits.

Gideon's favourite motif is 'the history of the flesh'. He insists obscurely that [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Histories/Histories]] should be woven, not written. Gideon speaks reverently of the 'wyrd-weft', which he has achieved by applying [[Stitching & Binding]] arts to a fabric in the presence of sufficient [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Heart]].

He laments however that its complexities only approach those understood by the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Sisterhood of the knot]], which in turn are only a shadow of 'the true [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Braid of Histories]]'.

Chilu notes:
- This book contains a [[Crafting Recipes|crafting recipe]] explaining how to create 'wyrd-weft' using [[Stitching & Binding]] and [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Heart]]
- 'wyrd-weft' is nothing compared to techniques known by [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Sisterhood of the knot]]
