In which Amira Zahra prophesies the events later known as the Intercalate, when the Hour called Sun-in-Splendour will be divided.

The Sun will be divided that it might not sire children. Still its children shall be Four in number and its children shall be Seven in number and its children shall also be Numberless. The Numberless shall open the way for the Seven, and the Seven shall consume the Four...'

Amira prophesies four great wars before the Second Dawn, when the Sun-in-Splendour shall rise again. She cautions: 'Sunrise is blood, and I foretell now that the Sun shall rise from blood, yet not the colour of the blood, nor the hour of Night.' She includes a rite that she speculates will be necessary for the Second Dawn.
