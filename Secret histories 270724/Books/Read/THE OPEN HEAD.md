Ilse Bischoff's hallucinatory quasi-documentary, notionally about the Greco-Turkish War of the previous decade.    „
Upon choosing to master the film, the Librarian learns:

A hammer-armed Turk and a sword-armed Greek pursue each other through the Pindus, setting traps for each other, robbing peasants, chalking insulting graffiti on walls. The tone is notionally anti-war, but any scholar of the invisible arts would recognise the Edge-hour subtext... and the Hyksos messages in the graffiti.

The sword-wielder methodically fills a church with candles; lights each one; strips, again, to the waist to reveal his terrible scars; his chest somehow swings open like a cupboard door to reveal a blood-drenched book… and the film ends.
