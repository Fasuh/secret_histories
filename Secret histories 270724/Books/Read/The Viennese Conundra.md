Was used to teach [[Vonte]] [[Wolf Stories]]

Van Driel describes odd events in [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/places 1/Vienna]] - the disappearance of children; epidemics of parasite activity; animal mutilations; nightmares of [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Worms]]; the activities of a charitable organization, the New [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Ligeians/Ligeians]], that funds the burial of the poor. She proposes peculiar connections between these activities.

When the individual K. attends the meetings, black dogs are sacrificed and quartered. When the element M. is in attendance, black mares are found with their throats slashed. I propose that these sacrifices are not necessary, but that our [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Ligeians/Ligeians|Ligeian]] friends may consider them 'fitting'. 

Herewith diagrams of the mutilations -'[[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Medusa's Riddle]], then, I choose to render as 'What is Not Seen?' There is another riddle, one I have heard rendered as 'What may be Lost?' I will delineate some historic attempts to answer it- these are in themselves, in some sense, sacrifices - '

Chilu notes:
- Nightmares of [[Games/Secret histories/wth/Worms|Worms]] could mean the worms that live [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/places 1/Nowhere]]
- New [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Ligeians/Ligeians]] is curious because as far as we know theres only seven [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Ligeians/Ligeians]]
- Individual K. could mean one of [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Ligeians/Ligeians]]
- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Medusa's Riddle]] is mentioned.
