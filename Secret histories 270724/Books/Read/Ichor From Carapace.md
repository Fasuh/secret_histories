Book written about the Cross and how their sacrifices were apparently made to give rise to the oldest created hours.

The rites of the Cross were observed and replicated by people of Steppe in a spectacularly gruesome manner. The people of the Steppe were innumerable, yet when the rites were done, they were none.

The author finally refers to themselves as a flower-bearer. Ascended under the Honey-Tree to forever remember the rites of whom they were before passing into humanity.
