A rare surviving copy of Christopher Illopoly's notoriously unsuccessful volume of experimental poetry, published in 1912.

Illopoly is clearly more interested in the occult than the aesthetic aspects of the work. By most measures, the rhymes are contrived; the meter inconsistent; the imagery banal. Still, even the worst verses have a compelling quality, and I find myself drumming my fingers on the desk to accompany their rhythms.

In an afterword, Illopoly discusses 'mnemonic holometaboly', by which he seems to mean a sort of crafting process where memories, when fed into a Preliminal Meter technique in the presence of enough Knock or Rose, can 'blossom and fissure' into more potent versions of themselves...
