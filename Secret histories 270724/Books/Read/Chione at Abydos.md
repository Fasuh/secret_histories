A play dealing with the nine-year sojourn of a [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/gods from nowhere/Snow|snow*]]-goddess in the Thracian city of [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/places 1/Abydos]], by 'Apollo Fireweaver'. In English, published in 1892; purportedly from an older [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Languages/Greek]] text.

The entity called '[[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Chione]]' arrives in a blizzard and demands the city gates are barred. As [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/places 1/Abydos]] falls under her spell, the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Dead]] return, but do not speak...

For eight years the city is a place of slow death, frosty ecstacy and silent beauty, but in the ninth year a [[Conspiracy of Shouts]] is mounted against the quiet that [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Chione]] demands. The conspirators open the city gates, and a [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Colonel|scarred man*]] comes to drag [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Chione]] out by the hair. Summer returns, but the conspirators die of remorse.

Chilu notes:
- Snow-goddess could refer to [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/gods from nowhere/Snow]] who is one of [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/gods from nowhere/gods-from-Nowhere]]
- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Chione]] is probably the name of the snow-goddess
- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Chione]] spell makes dead return but they are unable to speak.
- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Chione]] was taken by a scarred man. [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Colonel]] is often called The Scarred Hour
- We could assume [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Chione]] is a part of if not a whole of [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Seven Coils]] as mentioned by [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Acquaintences/Ms Azita Bukhara]]
- [[Conspiracy of Shouts]] could be something worth asking [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Acquaintences/Ms Azita Bukhara]]
