Sacred poems composed in honour of the Hours venerated by the Sisterhood of the Triple Knot.

The Grail is celebrated for her colours, the Malachite for her sweetness, the Axe for her constancyâ€¦

The Thunderskin, least of the Hours of the Knot when he is even counted among their number at all, is celebrated with an unexpectedly poignant elegy. 'What lives, departs; what is dead, remains.'
