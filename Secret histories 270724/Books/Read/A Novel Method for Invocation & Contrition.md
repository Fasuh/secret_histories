#Rose #Book 

Ingenious and rather beautiful techniques for entreating the Names of the Hours, developed by Rory Morrow, who styled himself 'the Sage-Knight'.

The techniques rely on the unique qualities of the Ericapaean tongue. Morrow professes himself surprised that they serve better to entreat the Names of the Vagabond than the Names of Lantern or Winter Hours…

Morrow demonstrates that Preliminal Meter techniques can be used with sufficient Rose to invoke the Vagabond's Names, transforming an Enduring Reflection into 'something wider of sky.'
