Was used to [[Upgrading]] [[Alitri - LADY REINA THISTLEBOROUGH]] [[Lockworks & Clockworks]]

The second volume of [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Authors/Teresa Galmier|Teresa Galmier's]] examination of parallels in the mystic dreams of artisans. The frontispiece has been slashed with a razor.

In this volume, [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Authors/Teresa Galmier|Glamier]] records fewer dreams, and explicates more of her own elaborate theories. 'We see this again and again: what is below can't escape what is above.'

'The finest artisans all dream of the [[White Door]] in the end. I'm no artisan, only a scholar. I think there's a Secret that all these artisans know, but I think that Secret is only half the story.'

Chilu notes:
- Artisans dream of the [[White Door]]
- Is [[White Door]] somehow connected to [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Forge]]?
