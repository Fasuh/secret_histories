A very heterodox history of the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/House of Lethe]] as recorded by 'the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Serenity]]' - a [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/House of Lethe|Lethean]] adept who declares that the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/House of Lethe]] was created explicitly to prevent the ascension of any more mortals to [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Names|Name]] or [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Hours|Hour]] status.

‘[[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Eternity]] cannot be escaped; but in [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Histories/Histories|History]], it may be delayed,’ the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Serenity]] explains. ‘The [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/gods-who-were-flesh]], by their nature, are a surrender to [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Eternity]].’

The 'roots of the House' are said to pass into the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Wood]] of dreams through three forests in the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/The Bounds|Bounds]], identified as the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/The Three Forests of the Bounds|Bei Ilai]], the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/The Three Forests of the Bounds|Black Cedar Forest]], and the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/The Three Forests of the Bounds|Brecheliant]]. 'While one tree of these may yet stand, one single tree, the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Histories/Histories]] continue.

Chilu notes:
- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/House of Lethe]] was created to prevent ascension
- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Eternity]] seems to affect [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/gods-who-were-flesh]] but in [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Histories/Histories]] its delayed
- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/The Three Forests of the Bounds]] are mentioned here: Bei Ilai, Black Cedar Forest and Brecheliant.
- As long as those forests exist at all the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Histories/Histories]] will continue
