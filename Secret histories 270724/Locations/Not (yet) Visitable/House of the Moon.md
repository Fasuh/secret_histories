The [[House of the Moon]] is a strange reflection of the [[House of the Sun]], presided over by the [[The Meniscate]].

[[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Languages/Killasimi]] could maybe be the native tongue of [[House of the Moon]]

Chilu notes:
- To enter [[House of the Moon]] [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Long]] have to commit their lives to the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Moon]] by [[Nyctodromy]]
- It is uncertain whether [[House of the Moon]] and [[House of the Sun]] are reflections in a literal sense
	- It is possible that they are within different [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Histories/Histories]]
