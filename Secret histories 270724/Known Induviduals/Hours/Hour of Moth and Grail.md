Mentioned in:
- [[Resurgences & Emergences]]
- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Acquaintences/Dr Arun Peel]]

Curiously mentioned in [[Resurgences & Emergences]] as [[Hour of Grail and Moth]] and [[Hour of Moth and Grail]]. Possibly they are the [[Twins]] since [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Acquaintences/Dr Arun Peel]] suggested that the [[Red Grail]] challenged the [[Twins]] over the aspect of [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Heart]].

All three [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Grail]], [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Moth]] and [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Heart]] are aspects of [[The Bosk]]

Chilu notes:
- Its possible that they are the [[Twins]].
- It is possible that they are [[Sister-and-Witch]]
- The order in which the aspect of [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Grail]] and [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Moth]] is mentioned could mean which [[Twins|Twin]] you are referring to first.
