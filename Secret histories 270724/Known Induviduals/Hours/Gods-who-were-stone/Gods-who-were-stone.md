List of known [[Gods-who-were-stone]]:
- [[Wheel]]
- [[Flint]]
- [[Tide]]

Possibly the same as [[gods-from-stone]]

They are the first of [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Hours]]

They are said to reside in the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Labyrinths]] under [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/places 1/Mansus]], above [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Wood]] and inside the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Moon]],
they are left there to sleep, hide or rot. They would possibly be consumed by [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/gods-who-are]] if they left the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Labyrinths]]

They ruled during the time of Stone, and made a law that keys of dream cannot be held of owned.

They were defeated during [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Lithomachy]]

[[Tridesma Hiera]] describes how [[Gods-who-were-stone]] were consumed by respective principles:
- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Moth]] consumed [[Wheel]]
- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Grail]] consumed [[Tide]]
- In the days of the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Forge]], the stars fled from every facet of [[Flint]]

Chilu notes:
- Possibly [[Gods-who-were-stone]] are the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Hours]] who came from [[gods-from-stone]]
	- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Moth]] is [[Wheel]]
	- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Grail]] is [[Tide]]
	- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Forge]] is [[Flint]]
- Probably [[Flint]] [[Wheel]] and [[Tide]] are not in [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Labyrinths]] because it is said that they were consumed
- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Lithomachy]] means "stone battles"
- Known [[Gods-who-were-stone]] seem to reference tools and phenomenons that could be seen during Stone age
- Time of Stone could reference Stone age
