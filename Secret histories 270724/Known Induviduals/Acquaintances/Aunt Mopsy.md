That publisher in Kerisham. I promised her if she did right by me, she'd never see me again. Well, dear, a promise is a promise, but a story is a story. If you let me touch those nectar books, I promise I'll give it back.
i gave her [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Books/Cross' Savour-Secret|Cross' Savour-Secret]] and she fkin kidnapped it.

do you know about a secret that has been hidden?
Plenty plenty plenty. Went through many recipes that I have written down. Go through the Woods and you can just take a Shovel. below the Roots and the Thorns. but ofc the greatest secrets are the things the hours themselves wish to hid you know of calyptra dont you?
ofc
well if you know what calyptra has hidden then you know what should be brought to the light.

what was hidden or how should i look for it?
the easiest answer ofc is to just look around the wind itself has rumours within it and ofc whatever may arise from the earth it was hidden for a good reason, or if you wish to be especially blasphemous you could consult with those who are from nowhere, they are not a bad bunch.

what can you tell me about the velvet?
she is a capritious and hateful lil creature who loves hiding things in every tree in the woods life was so much better without it i wish we could go back to the times when velvet wasnt, but we cant always get what we want can we?

can you give me back my book?
in due time?
when is the due time?
when i return

what is the Cukoo-Honey?
its a delicacy, something that has been long forgotten now sadly how to make, but sometimes it happens to show up, i blame the other histories, i bet you could find them in those other histories. 

What are the proverbs you collected?
oh they are long and many that existed through lots and lots of rumours that were chirped out from aviform hours long forgotten ones if may add as well.

what are teh aviform hours?
in alphabetical order or? 
in the other order
of course it is the crow the laughingtrush the dove and the twin kite, or as simple folk may know them as the beachcomer the vagabond, the Elegiast and the twins.

tell me all you can about the vagabond.
what is there to say she travels she sees and she talks lots....... shes sometimes sits down with one of the ligeians and talks all of the new longs that entered teh world as well once upon the time but not the roost no no the roost is only for those of teh feathery nature, even though they lack them.
