>My family-of-the-moment are total sweethearts, of course they are, but I am just the tiniest bit restlessâ€¦ and, well, if anyone in Venice might find themselves suddenly down a daughter, I'd like to have done my research.

# Questions

## Do you follow any particular hours?
>Of course i do, im in particular for the flowermaker, he is such a sweetheart. 
## Do you know of the means to contact him?
>Him... well, many times he loves to visit the red church, but his main area of expertise is teh glass garden, a bit of a travel for the likes of you, no insult intended. as you can see the glass garden is beyond peacock door.
## Is there perhaps a god of grail or heart that is easier to reach?
>you would possibly be able to try the twins, if you are seeking more of the grail you are seeking the witch and sister, if heart possibly a sister and witch they love sometimes roaming around the woods. Lesser being if you ask me.
## Can you tell me more about the flowermaker?
>The flowermaker is a greedy power of things too wonderful to bare, he was born from the spark of delight which created the first forbidden act of the forge of days and now creates woderful things perhaps too wonderful, the flowermaker promises to fulfill any desire if the one can only find him, he is of the aspect of lantern grail and sky, and his hour is 7PM
