One-time Librarian of Hush House, one-time Librarian of the Invisible Serapeum in Alexandria, and currently... what, exactly? Serena is close-mouthed, but I know that she has worked with the St Rhonwen Trust.

Zidane is dead. It's a pity: the man was an artist. And it's concerning: I wonder if the death might not have something to do with his last work.

He was already making use of some very unusual alloys - very unusual techniques. I'd like to use the collection to develop some theories further with his notes.

I think Zidane might have been using [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Ys]]-metal in his work. That would upset quite a number of people, from the Bureau on downâ€¦. thank you, friend. I hope I can always trust you to keep our conversations confidential.

Where did Zidane die?
He died in Budapest

Where would one find remaining notes from the invisible Serapeum of Alexandria?
Quite a curious question asked of a librarian, what do you need and i may be able to provide some of it.

Why would working with [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Ys]] metal in particular upset people?
Because it doesn't exist. It only exists because people believe it should exist not unlike the city unbuilt , everything of [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Ys]] is a fabrication of dreams that only exists because we dare to dream of them, and some unchecked dreaming can cause a lot of problem with the bureau

is sunset rite a right ritual to change 
yes, there are a couple

does it matter what rite we use?
i prefer [[Rite of the Map's Edge|Rite of the Map's Edge]] its more fluid, requires less people

what principles are required for that rite with [[A Shaping Chant|A Shaping Chant]]
ofc forge, lots and lots of forge.

how much forge would be required to change a commitment in a skill?
a wisdom?
before i answer i must know for lets just say professional reasons, why would you want to change your wisdom?
i seek the path of preservation but earlier in my studies i accidentally delved iun the path of nyctodromy and i wish to change that particular ability to preservation.
i see. i would highly recommend using iotic essense while you are delving in that rite, it gives you quite a bit of head start to deal with such an erratic change, but i should be amiss to not tell you this, the hours are watching you now, and changing history so curiously may raise attention.

i have a friend of my that wishes to knwo more about [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Forge|Forge]] hours 
ofc, there is without the doubt the forge of days herself, then the lionsmith, if the lionsmith is not somethign of your level, and oyu wish to forge more reliant on the dead then Madrugad should help you, if not Madrugad then it should be the meniscate, then if not meniscate then perhaps you are lost
