comission seals for a coffin?

[[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Saint Mikhail's Coffin]] - wouldn't want him to get. [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Mother of Ants]] would not prefer that. Need to look up some Seals for that. He is a rather unfortuitous person. Specifically, a rambunctious [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Alukite]], committed the crime of the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Sky]] after he entered his long journey into the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Histories/Histories|History]] itself. [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Mother of Ants]] would not want him out, before he commits such a crime again.

Chilu notes:
- She seems to serve [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Mother of Ants]]
- [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Mother of Ants]] is mentioned multiple times, i.e. [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Acquaintences/Dr Arun Peel]] mentiones how she helped [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Colonel]] take down [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Seven Coils]]
