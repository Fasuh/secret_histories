Metallurgist, gourmet, corrupted immortal. And, supposedly, a long-ago king's by-blow.

Some cretin is attempting to stage the Invisible Opera in Venice. Well, I suppose if anything catches fire, Venice is less inclined than most cities to burn. When the production fails - and it will - I wish to take full advantage of the situation. Do not concern yourself with the details. I have all the details at my command apprentice.

anything about the mother of ants?
why would you want to know something like that?
because u told me i would need a help from the mother of ants and i dont want to help from a ligeian
i like it, 
im not the best person to do this. are you gonna know about the ol mother of ants, she is the daugher of the father. the daughter of venims? saint agnims herself, and all the hooded princes are from her lineage. at least in some shape or form, interconnected. Them serpentfolk are rather obnoxious abt the fact that our good ol mommy is always watching over them. otherwise if the stories of eld are to be believed she is the one who helped the colonel ascend to the prestigious position that he is right now. but otherwise idk too much about her either.

if not through the mother of ants how dfid you ascend?
well i didnt say i didnt ascend through her, i did but more off through her children, i was one of odor liae im p sure i was the only man in the odor limiae back then
i was part of of ordo limiae but you know, things came around, appetites rose and i may have dabbled with the crime of the sky, now because of that i started making connections and one thing led to the other and sulochana graciously showed me a few curious paths in mansus end and maliuary, was ready to receive me
u understand forge is not merely for crafting weapons or light or steel or fancy weapons unbreakable cages etc.... no, we as forge could craft better things than any of the velvet or malachite could ever, those forbidden fruits lead to quite a recipee

The Ordo Limiae\

when i get through the spider gate would you show me the way through the maliary
if, sure.

how do i contact mother of ants from [[../Doors/Way The Wood|Way The Wood]]?
you must talk with sulochana, thats the easiest way to do it.
i didnt ask for easy
the hard way is to somehow penetrate through the gate itself without asking for permission.

what should i do when i dream about the white door?
look around enjoy it, it is the only pausible place that you can enjoy left in the mansus, other than the maliary ofc, theres a lot of knowledge that you can get after you penetrate it. it should prepare you for the ascension.
should the knowledge or the door prepare me for the ascension?
the knowledge.
white door isnt as thicc as people claim to be
