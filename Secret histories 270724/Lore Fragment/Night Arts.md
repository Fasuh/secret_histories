'The invisible arts,' Christopher Illopoly is said to have remarked, 'are as profitable as macram√©, as ethical as tobacco-smuggling, and in general as beneficial as roulette. Still, there is always the Orchard of Lights.' And indeed, the Orchard, with its glowing fruit and its peaceful mists, is a place to be yearned for. Last night I walked there in the peaceful hours of the deep night. Even after waking, I still carry with me a little of the glory of the old Sun.

In the Depth of the House of the Moon there is still one Gate left. But some say it is not a Gate at all.
