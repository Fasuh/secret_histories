"The Hunter, the Way, and their memories."

When the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Principles/Moth]] goes a-hunting in the dark of the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Wood]], he remembers a time when the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Wood]] was bright, but he uses his horns to find the way, and we may follow him if we choose. After all, a trophy is nothing without a hunt: that's the lesson of the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Wood]].

When the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Chandler]] goes a-hunting in the dark of the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Wood]], he shields his candle so his prey is not forewarned, but he leaves a trail of ivory wax so we may follow him and purchase his prizes. After all, the goal of every hunt is to bring home a trophy, and when we understand [[Skolekosophy]], we know how to bargain.
