"Break a window. What have you made? A way? A new light? A weapon?"

A paradox of [[Illumination]]: light reveals, light blinds. This is the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Watchman tree/Lesson of the White Flower]] of the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Watchman tree/Watchman Tree|Watchman's Tree]]: even the most dangerous of knowledge is no danger at all when it is forgotten. 

A lesson from [[Ithastry]]: fire reveals, smoke conceals. This is the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Watchman tree/Lesson of the Red Flower]] of the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Watchman tree/Watchman Tree|Watchman's Tree]]: even the most dangerous of knowledge is no danger at all when it is given to the fire.

Glazery is mirrors, locking the light in them, and stuff
without light this whole world would be not completely engulfed in darkness, light is an abomination
