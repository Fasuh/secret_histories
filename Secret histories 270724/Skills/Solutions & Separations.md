The surgeon plies the knife and the mason plies the chisel. There are subtler tools than either.

The world is all imbalance, and imbalance is opportunity. Moth knows that; Worms prove it. This is Skolekosophy.

The world is all imbalance. With time, with care, with ingenuity, we can retore the balance, through the shaping of stone, the equilibrium of ichors, the unhatching of the egg. Ithastry teaches ingenuity.
