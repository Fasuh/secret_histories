The oldest Hours are the gods-from-blood, who rose from sacrifice. That blood was always spilt on the roots, and the rites of its spilling are still remembered.

The oldest living hours are the gods-who-were-blood. The gods-from-Stone were older still, but they're buried in the earth, scattered in the sea, lost to the moon. This is why we're always careful where we make the sacrifice, because if we spilt enough blood on their graves, they'd return for their revenge. Bosk knows.

The oldest living hours are the gods-who-were-blood. The gods-from-Stone were older still, but they're buried in the earth, scattered in the sea, lost to the moon. This is why we're always careful where we make the sacrifice: without it, the gods-from-Stone would pass from memory. This is Preservation.
