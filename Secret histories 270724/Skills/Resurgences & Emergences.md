"Birth and death are only directions. Between the two we find a crossroads."

The [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Gods-who-were-stone/gods-from-stone]] made a law that the keys of dream cannot be held or owned. The time of Stone is past, but the keys remain. So the holders of these keys can only be the seven [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Ligeians/Ligeians]], whose crime has set them outside the law. But the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Ligeians/Ligeians]] serve an [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Hour of Grail and Moth]]: when the last remnants of the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Gods-who-were-stone/gods-from-stone]] are consumed, the law will be consumed with them. [[The Bosk]] is the wisdom of change.
