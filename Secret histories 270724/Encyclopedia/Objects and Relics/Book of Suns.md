There seem to be two versions of this book:
- Received version
- Sanctioned version

Received version is the "pure" version of the book.
Sanctioned version seems to be a version that's made to align with the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/Church of the Unconquered Sun|Church]]

The book seems to talk about the [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/wth/gods-from-Light]] and more specifically [[Chillu Notes/Secret histories Chilu Ver/Hours/Sun-in-Splendour]].
